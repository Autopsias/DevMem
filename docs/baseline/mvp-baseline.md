# MVP Baseline Measurements

## Delegation Accuracy

Current system performance across core test scenarios:

- Single Agent Tasks: ~60% success
- Sequential Handoff: ~40% success  
- Parallel Execution: ~30% success
- Meta-coordination: ~20% success
- Cross-domain Tasks: ~25% success

Overall baseline accuracy: 20-40% depending on task mix

## Response Time Performance
