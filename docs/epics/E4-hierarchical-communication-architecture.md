# ðŸ”— **EPIC 4: HIERARCHICAL COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE**

**Epic ID**: E4  
**Phase**: 2  
**Duration**: 6-8 hours  
**Story Points**: 34  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: E3 (Framework Critical Fixes)  

## **Epic Description**
Establish structured communication patterns between primary and secondary agents for effective coordination.

## **Business Value**
Creates sophisticated agent coordination architecture enabling primary agents to spawn secondary agents with structured communication, conflict resolution, and integrated solution synthesis.

## **Stories in this Epic**
- **[Story 4.1]** Primary-Secondary Communication Protocol Design (21 SP)
- **[Story 4.2]** Primary Agent Result Aggregation Enhancement (8 SP)
- **[Story 4.3]** Natural Language Communication Optimization (5 SP)

## **Epic Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Structured communication protocols between primary and secondary agents
- âœ… Primary agents can spawn secondary agents with coordination context
- âœ… Secondary agents provide hierarchical response format with integration intelligence
- âœ… Cross-domain conflict analysis and resolution framework operational
- âœ… Unified solution creation integrates all domain findings
- âœ… Natural language communication patterns optimized and standardized

## **Dependencies & Blockers**
- **Prerequisites**: E3 must be complete (all primary agents updated)
- **Blocks**: E5 (Framework Completion) requires communication architecture
- **Risk Level**: High - Complex coordination architecture with extensive integration

## **Technical Requirements**
- Primary Agent Spawning Protocol with structured prompts
- Standardized Task() delegation template with coordination context
- Secondary Agent Response Protocol with hierarchical awareness
- Cross-domain integration intelligence (conflicts, dependencies, synergies)
- Implementation sequencing guidance for multi-domain solutions
- Coordination ID system for tracking agent relationships

## **Communication Architecture Components**
- **Spawning Protocol**: How primary agents delegate to secondary agents
- **Response Protocol**: How secondary agents report back with integration awareness
- **Conflict Resolution**: Framework for handling contradictory recommendations  
- **Integration Strategy**: Process for creating unified solutions
- **Natural Language Templates**: Standardized communication patterns

## **Definition of Done**
- [ ] All 3 stories completed and accepted
- [ ] Primary-secondary communication protocols implemented
- [ ] Result aggregation and conflict resolution operational
- [ ] Natural language communication optimized
- [ ] End-to-end hierarchical coordination tested
- [ ] Documentation and templates created

## **Success Metrics**
- Structured spawning protocol ensures consistent agent delegation
- Cross-domain integration intelligence identifies conflicts and synergies
- Conflict resolution follows structured decision framework
- Communication templates facilitate effective coordination

## **Notes**
- Largest epic by story points - complex coordination architecture
- Foundation for sophisticated multi-domain problem solving
- Critical for framework's advanced capabilities
