## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Categories and Mitigation

#### 1. Technical Complexity Risks

**Risk**: Memory Integration Complexity (HIGH)
- **Impact**: Could delay STORY-2.1C by 1-2 weeks
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Early prototyping of memory integration patterns (Week 1)
  - Fallback to simplified memory approach if <25ms target unachievable
  - Alternative coordination-hub.md integration path prepared
- **Contingency**: Use existing <50ms memory performance as acceptable baseline

**Risk**: Performance Optimization Challenges (MEDIUM)
- **Impact**: May not achieve <25ms memory access target
- **Mitigation**:
  - Establish performance baseline early (Week 1)
  - Implement incremental optimization approach
  - Prepare rollback to baseline performance if optimization fails
- **Contingency**: Accept <50ms as production-ready performance level

**Risk**: Cross-Story Integration Complexity (MEDIUM)
- **Impact**: Integration between stories may require additional development time
- **Mitigation**:
  - Define clear integration contracts between stories (Week 2)
  - Implement integration testing early in each phase
  - Weekly cross-story synchronization meetings
- **Contingency**: Reduce scope of advanced integration features if needed

#### 2. Timeline and Schedule Risks

**Risk**: Quality Gate Delays (MEDIUM)
- **Impact**: Each failed quality gate could add 3-5 days to timeline
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement quality gate checkpoints 2 days before scheduled gates
  - Prepare alternative approaches for each quality gate
  - Build 1-week buffer into overall timeline
- **Contingency**: Staged delivery with MVP functionality first

**Risk**: Resource Availability (MEDIUM)
- **Impact**: Specialist unavailability could delay specific phases
- **Mitigation**:
  - Cross-train team members on multiple specializations
  - Maintain relationships with backup specialist contractors
  - Front-load critical specialist work early in timeline
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks if specialists unavailable

#### 3. Requirements and Scope Risks

**Risk**: Anthropic Compliance Changes (LOW)
- **Impact**: Compliance requirement changes could impact entire Epic
- **Mitigation**:
  - Monitor Anthropic guideline updates weekly
  - Implement flexible compliance framework

- **Contingency**: Rapid compliance adjustment procedures prepared

**Risk**: Performance Target Infeasibility (MEDIUM)
- **Impact**: Aggressive performance targets may be technically infeasible
- **Mitigation**:
  - Early performance feasibility validation (Week 1)
  - Incremental performance improvement approach
  - Alternative performance targets prepared
- **Contingency**: Negotiate revised performance targets with stakeholders

#### 4. Dependency and Integration Risks

**Risk**: Existing System Disruption (HIGH)
- **Impact**: Changes could break existing agent functionality
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive backward compatibility testing at each phase
  - Implement feature flags for all new functionality
  - Maintain parallel deployment capability
- **Contingency**: Immediate rollback procedures with <30 second recovery

**Risk**: MCP Service Dependencies (MEDIUM)
- **Impact**: External MCP services could be unreliable during development
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement comprehensive mocking for MCP services
