# ðŸ”§ **EPIC 3: FRAMEWORK CRITICAL FIXES**

**Epic ID**: E3  
**Phase**: 1  
**Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: E2 (True Parallel Execution Core)  

## **Epic Description**
Complete all primary agent updates and fix routing issues to enable full framework functionality.

## **Business Value**
Transforms the theoretical parallel execution foundation into a fully operational agent framework with complete coverage across all 16 primary agents and optimized routing logic.

## **Stories in this Epic**
- **[Story 3.1]** Complete ALL Primary Agent Updates (13 SP)
- **[Story 3.2]** Fix Analysis-Gateway Routing (5 SP)
- **[Story 3.3]** End-to-End Workflow Testing (3 SP)

## **Epic Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… ALL 16 primary agents updated with parallel execution capabilities
- âœ… ALL primary agents have hierarchical communication + synthesis capabilities  
- âœ… Complete framework coverage with no agent gaps
- âœ… analysis-gateway uses direct Task() calls for multi-domain problems
- âœ… meta-coordinator only used for 5+ domain strategic coordination
- âœ… End-to-end workflows validated from problem to synthesis

## **Dependencies & Blockers**
- **Prerequisites**: E2 must be complete (parallel execution required for agent updates)
- **Blocks**: E4 (Hierarchical Communication) requires fully updated agents
- **Risk Level**: High - Critical framework functionality with extensive scope

## **Technical Requirements**
- Update all 16 primary agents with parallel Task() execution capabilities
- Implement hierarchical communication protocols across all agents
- Fix analysis-gateway routing with direct Task() calls
- Create standardized Task() call templates for each agent type
- Validate complete workflows with synthesis-coordinator integration

## **Agent Categories for Update**
- **Core Analysis** (3): digdeep, test-specialist, code-quality-specialist
- **Infrastructure** (3): infrastructure-engineer, ci-specialist, environment-analyst  
- **Intelligence** (3): intelligent-enhancer, meta-coordinator, framework-coordinator
- **Development Support** (4): git-commit-assistant, agent-reviewer, agent-creator, lint-enforcer
- **Specialized** (3): security-enforcer, token-monitor, user-feedback-coordinator

## **Definition of Done**
- [ ] All 3 stories completed and accepted
- [ ] All 16 primary agents updated and tested
- [ ] analysis-gateway routing fixed and validated
- [ ] End-to-end workflows tested successfully
- [ ] Framework coverage verified complete
- [ ] Performance metrics show improved routing efficiency

## **Success Metrics**
- 100% primary agent framework coverage achieved
- Reduced latency for multi-domain problems
- Successful synthesis-coordinator integration
- Conflict resolution working for contradictory recommendations

## **Notes**
- Largest scope epic - may require additional sprint planning
- Critical for framework operability
- Foundation for all hierarchical communication
