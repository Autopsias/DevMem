# EPIC 4: Strategic MCP Assignment System Implementation

## Epic Information
- **Epic ID**: EPIC-4
- **Epic Title**: Strategic MCP Assignment & Configuration System
- **Epic Owner**: Product Owner
- **Epic Status**: Not Started
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Target Release**: Phase 2.5 (Weeks 4-5) - EXTENDS EPIC-2
- **Dependencies**: EPIC-1 (Infrastructure Foundation), EPIC-2 (Agent Enhancement)

## Epic Description

**Problem Statement**: Based on comprehensive MCP server analysis, the current generic MCP assignments across 36 agents create inefficiency, redundancy, and suboptimal performance. Every single agent needs function-specific MCP configurations combined with individual MCP best practice implementation to achieve optimal coordination effectiveness.

**Solution Overview**: Implement strategic, function-based MCP server assignments across ALL 36 agents, eliminate redundant MCPs, deploy optimized 9-MCP stack with specialized configurations per agent category, and ensure every agent incorporates latest MCP integration best practices as detailed in comprehensive analysis.

**User Value**: As a framework user, I want optimized MCP assignments that provide precisely the right tools for each agent's function so that I experience faster responses, better coordination accuracy, and more cost-effective operations.
