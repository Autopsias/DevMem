# ðŸ“ˆ **EPIC 6: PERFORMANCE & PRODUCTION READINESS**

**Epic ID**: E6  
**Phase**: 4  
**Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Story Points**: 21  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: E5 (Framework Completion)  

## **Epic Description**
Optimize for Claude Code's metrics and establish production-ready framework with comprehensive testing.

## **Business Value**
Transforms the complete agent framework into a production-ready system with optimized performance, native Claude Code integration, and comprehensive testing framework for enterprise deployment.

## **Stories in this Epic**
- **[Story 6.1]** Claude Code Performance Optimization (13 SP)
- **[Story 6.2]** Claude Code Settings Integration (5 SP)
- **[Story 6.3]** Enhanced Testing Framework (3 SP)

## **Epic Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Prompt caching reduces repeated coordination overhead
- âœ… Token usage estimation prevents budget overruns  
- âœ… Optimized prompts improve execution efficiency
- âœ… Configuration loads from Claude Code's native settings system
- âœ… Dynamic adjustment improves performance over time
- âœ… All Claude Code coordination patterns are tested
- âœ… Performance benchmarks establish baseline metrics

## **Dependencies & Blockers**
- **Prerequisites**: E5 must be complete (full framework required for optimization)
- **Blocks**: None - final epic in sequence
- **Risk Level**: Low - Optimization and testing with clear scope

## **Technical Requirements**
- Claude Code performance optimization with prompt caching
- Token usage estimation and optimization
