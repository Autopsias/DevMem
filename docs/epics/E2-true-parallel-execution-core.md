# ⚡ **EPIC 2: TRUE PARALLEL EXECUTION CORE**

**Epic ID**: E2  
**Phase**: 0  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Story Points**: 13  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Dependencies**: E1 (Claude Code Optimization Foundation)  

## **Epic Description**
Implement Claude Code's native parallel execution using multiple Task() calls with optimization layer integration.

## **Business Value**
Enables true simultaneous agent execution within Claude Code's native capabilities, dramatically improving performance for multi-domain problems while maintaining resource awareness and intelligent batching.

## **Stories in this Epic**
- **[Story 2.1]** Native Claude Code Parallel Execution (8 SP) - ✅ **Done**
- **[Story 2.2]** Architecture Balance & Claude Code Alignment (5 SP) - ✅ **Done**

## **Epic Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Multiple Task() calls trigger true parallel execution  
- ✅ Up to 10 agents can run simultaneously (Claude Code's limit)
- ✅ Intelligent batching for >6 agent coordinations
- ✅ Resource validation prevents system overload
- ✅ Results synthesis occurs after all parallel agents complete
- ✅ Architecture balanced with Claude Code's design principles

## **Dependencies & Blockers**
- **Prerequisites**: E1 must be complete (optimization layer required)
- **Blocks**: E3 (Framework Critical Fixes) requires parallel execution capability
- **Risk Level**: Medium - Core functionality with Claude Code integration complexity

## **Technical Requirements**
- Multiple Task() calls in single message for parallel execution
- Integration with coordination intelligence patterns from E1
- Resource validation before execution starts
- Coordination ID tracking and performance logging
- Results synthesis after parallel completion

## **Definition of Done**
- [x] All 2 stories completed and accepted
- [x] True parallel execution validated with multiple agents
- [x] Integration with E1 agent coordination intelligence working
- [x] Resource validation preventing overload
- [x] Performance logging and tracking operational
- [x] Architecture documentation updated

## **Success Metrics**
- Parallel execution confirmed by logs showing simultaneous agent activity
- Resource validation prevents >10 agent attempts
- Intelligent batching optimizes large coordinations
- Results synthesis integrates all parallel findings

## **Notes**
- Focus on Claude Code's native parallel capabilities
- Maintain balance between coordination and independence
- Research-validated optimization patterns integrated
