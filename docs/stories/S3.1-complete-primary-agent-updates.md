- **Scope**: System orchestration, deployment, and environment management
- **Pattern**: Parallel execution for infrastructure + performance coordination
- **Integration**: Cross-domain communication with security and quality agents

### **Category 3: Intelligence (3 agents)**
- **Scope**: AI-powered enhancement, meta-coordination, and framework management
- **Pattern**: Strategic parallel coordination for complex multi-domain orchestration
- **Integration**: Meta-level hierarchical communication across all agent categories

### **Category 4: Development Support (4 agents)**
- **Scope**: Development workflow automation and quality assurance
- **Pattern**: Parallel coordination for workflow + validation processes
- **Integration**: Integration with git, quality, and testing workflows

### **Category 5: Specialized Coordination (3 agents)**
- **Scope**: Security, monitoring, and user interaction coordination
- **Pattern**: Specialized parallel execution for domain-specific coordination
- **Integration**: Cross-cutting concerns with all other agent categories

## **Technical Requirements**

- **Standardized Task() Templates**: Create templates for each agent type's parallel execution patterns
- **Hierarchical Communication**: Implement consistent communication protocols across all agents
- **Synthesis Integration**: Ensure all agents can coordinate with synthesis-coordinator
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintain or improve response times during parallel execution
- **Context Preservation**: Ensure context flows correctly through hierarchical communication

## **Integration Approach**

- **Phase 1**: Update Core Analysis agents (digdeep, test-specialist, code-quality-specialist)
- **Phase 2**: Update Infrastructure agents (infrastructure-engineer, ci-specialist, environment-analyst)
- **Phase 3**: Update Intelligence agents (intelligent-enhancer, meta-coordinator, framework-coordinator)
- **Phase 4**: Update Development Support agents (git-commit-assistant, agent-reviewer, agent-creator, lint-enforcer)
- **Phase 5**: Update Specialized agents (security-enforcer, token-monitor, user-feedback-coordinator)

## **Definition of Done**

- [ ] All 16 primary agents updated with parallel Task() execution capabilities
