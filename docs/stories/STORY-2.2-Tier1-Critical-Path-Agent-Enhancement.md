# STORY 2.2: Tier 1 Critical Path Agent Enhancement

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: STORY-2.2
- **Epic**: EPIC-2 - Agent Ecosystem Transformation
- **Story Title**: Tier 1 Critical Path Agent Enhancement
- **Story Owner**: Product Owner
- **Assignee**: Development Team
- **Story Points**: 13
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Sprint**: Sprint 5 (Week 5-6)

## User Story

**As a** framework user  
**I want** analysis-gateway, meta-coordinator, and test-specialist optimized  
**So that** I get superior problem routing and coordination intelligence

## Story Description

Enhance the three most critical agents that form the backbone of framework coordination: analysis-gateway (problem entry point), meta-coordinator (strategic orchestration), and test-specialist (template model).

## Business Value

- **Foundation Excellence**: Critical path agents optimized for superior user experience
- **Coordination Intelligence**: Enhanced routing and orchestration capabilities
- **Template Model**: test-specialist serves as enhancement template for other agents

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] analysis-gateway enhanced with optimal problem routing intelligence
- [ ] meta-coordinator optimized for strategic coordination (5+ domains)
- [ ] test-specialist refined as template model for other agents
- [ ] All three agents achieve <1s response time and >95% accuracy
- [ ] Natural delegation language optimized for automatic selection
- [ ] MCP integration implemented with progressive enhancement

### Should Have
- [ ] Cross-agent coordination patterns validated between the three agents
- [ ] Performance benchmarking completed for all three agents
- [ ] Documentation and best practices captured from enhancements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three agents enhanced using research-validated template
- [ ] Performance targets achieved (<1s response, >95% accuracy)
- [ ] Natural delegation working effectively
- [ ] MCP integration functional with fallback
- [ ] Cross-coordination tested and validated

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 2.2.1: analysis-gateway Enhancement (4.5 hours)
- Apply enhancement template with problem routing optimization
- Implement intelligent agent selection and batching logic
- Integrate natural delegation triggers for automatic selection
- Add MCP integration for enhanced problem analysis

### Task 2.2.2: meta-coordinator Enhancement (4.5 hours)
- Apply enhancement template with strategic orchestration focus
- Implement research-validated 4-agent batch optimization
- Add intelligent resource management and coordination strategies
- Integrate advanced coordination patterns for 5+ domain problems

### Task 2.2.3: test-specialist Refinement (4 hours)
- Refine existing S4.3 enhancements using enhancement template
- Standardize as template model for other agent enhancements
- Document patterns and approaches for replication
- Validate coordination with async-pattern-fixer and coverage-optimizer

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Response time: <1s average for all three agents
- [ ] Selection accuracy: >95% appropriate agent selection
- [ ] Coordination effectiveness: >90% successful multi-domain coordination
- [ ] Template quality: test-specialist serves as effective model for other agents

## Notes & Comments

**Critical Notes**: These agents are foundational to framework success. Their enhancement directly impacts all other coordination scenarios.

**Template Notes**: test-specialist should demonstrate the enhancement template's effectiveness and serve as a model for subsequent agent improvements.
