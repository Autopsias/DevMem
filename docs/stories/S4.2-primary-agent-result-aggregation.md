## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** framework developer,

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context
This story implements Epic 4's result aggregation and conflict resolution framework that enables unified solution creation across multiple domains. The implementation builds upon Epic 4's communication architecture components and technical requirements.

### Key Framework Integration Points
- **Communication Protocols**: Builds on Story 4.1's hierarchical communication architecture
- **Agent Coordination Patterns**: Leverages `.claude/memory/agent-coordination-patterns.md` for aggregation intelligence
- **Sequential Intelligence**: Supports complex sequential coordination with context accumulation
- **Meta-Orchestration**: Enables sophisticated strategic coordination for 4+ domain problems

### Technical Architecture Requirements
- **Agent Result Integration**: Enhanced agent configuration patterns in `.claude/agents/*.md` for synthesizing secondary responses
- **Agent Conflict Resolution**: Embedded coordination intelligence in agent `.md` files for handling contradictory recommendations
- **Agent Implementation Sequencing**: Enhanced coordination patterns in primary agent configurations for solution prioritization
- **Agent Solution Quality**: Embedded synthesis intelligence in agent `.md` configurations for coherent solution creation

### Critical Design Considerations
- **Domain Intelligence Preservation**: Aggregation must not lose critical domain-specific insights
- **Conflict Resolution Transparency**: Decision rationale must be clear and auditable
- **Implementation Practicality**: Sequencing must consider real-world constraints and dependencies
- **Solution Coherence**: Unified solutions must be internally consistent and actionable

### Testing Standards
- **Test Approach**: Agent coordination synthesis validation through Claude Code agent execution
- **Testing Method**: Primary agent result aggregation testing using actual secondary agent responses
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end synthesis workflows using enhanced agent configurations in `.claude/agents/`
- **Conflict Testing**: Agent coordination scenarios testing embedded conflict resolution intelligence
- **Validation Requirement**: Agent synthesis effectiveness measurement through coordination quality assessment

### Performance Requirements
- **Agent Synthesis**: <3s for result aggregation using enhanced primary agent configurations
- **Conflict Resolution**: <2s for embedded conflict detection through agent coordination intelligence
- **Solution Generation**: <5s for unified solution creation using enhanced agent synthesis patterns
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Minimal performance impact from agent configuration enhancements

### Integration Dependencies  
- **Story 4.1**: Requires completed communication protocols for secondary agent response collection
- **Agent Framework**: Integration with existing primary agent architecture and capabilities
- **Memory Patterns**: Utilization of coordination intelligence from framework memory systems
