# STORY-2.2: MCP Integration Enhancement

## Story Details
- **Points**: 12
- **Epic**: EPIC-2 Agent Ecosystem Optimization Excellence
- **Status**: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
- **Validated**: 2025-08-09
- **Estimated Effort**: 48 hours (1.5 weeks single developer)
- **Timeline Position**: Can begin parallel with final phases of STORY-2.1
- **Dependencies**: STORY-2.1A (delegation patterns for fallbacks)

## User Story
As a framework user,
I want enhanced MCP integration with progressive improvement patterns
So that I can leverage external services more reliably and efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement progressive enhancement pattern with all 4 levels (primary, secondary, tertiary, degraded)
2. Configure circuit breakers with specified thresholds (5 failures, 5s timeout, 30s recovery)
3. Achieve <3s fallback timeout for all service operations
4. Maintain >95% integration success rate over 5-minute windows
5. Implement graceful degradation with clear user notifications
6. Deploy intelligent batching with 3-5 request batches and 100ms debounce
7. Pass all unit, integration, performance, and resilience tests

## Technical Notes
### MCP Protocol Specifications
- Implement MCP v2.0 protocol handlers for external services
- Support async/await patterns with Promise.race() fallbacks
- Use typed message interfaces for service communication
- Implement retry strategies with exponential backoff

### Progressive Enhancement Pattern
- Primary: Direct MCP service integration with real-time responses
- Secondary: Cached response fallback (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Tertiary: Local processing fallback using simplified models
- Degraded: Clear user notification of service limitations

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
- Failure threshold: 5 consecutive failures
- Timeout threshold: 5s per request
- Recovery window: 30s between retry attempts
- Half-open state: Require 3 successful requests for recovery
- Error budget: 5% per 5-minute window

### Intelligent Batching Strategy
- Batch size: 3-5 requests per service call
- Debounce window: 100ms for request aggregation
- Service-specific optimizations:
  - Exa: Parallel batch processing
  - Perplexity: Sequential with shared context
- Fallback to individual requests on batch failure
