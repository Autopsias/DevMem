# Story S6.2: Claude Code Settings Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Claude Code Framework user,
**I want** native settings integration that loads agent configuration from Claude Code's settings system,
**so that** I can manage agent behavior through standard configuration files and environment variables.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Configuration loads from Claude Code's native settings system automatically
2. Environment variable configuration support enables deployment flexibility
3. Dynamic adjustment improves performance over time based on usage patterns
4. Settings changes take effect without requiring agent ecosystem restart
5. Configuration validation prevents invalid settings from breaking agent functionality
6. Default configurations ensure the system works out-of-the-box
7. Settings override hierarchy works correctly (environment > user settings > defaults)
8. All 34 agents respect the centralized configuration system

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story integrates the agent ecosystem with Claude Code's official hierarchical settings system using settings.json files. Claude Code supports user-level (~/.claude/settings.json), project-level (.claude/settings.json), and local (.claude/settings.local.json) configurations with enterprise managed policies for override capabilities.

### Relevant Source Tree
- ~/.claude/settings.json (user-level settings)
- .claude/settings.json (project-level settings, committed to repo)
- .claude/settings.local.json (local settings, git-ignored)
- .claude/memory/ configuration patterns  
- Agent framework configuration integration points
- Environment variable handling through Claude Code's "env" setting

### Key Technical Requirements
- Use Claude Code's official settings.json hierarchical configuration system
- Support all configuration levels: enterprise > user > project > local settings
- Integrate with Claude Code's "env" setting for environment variable injection
- Maintain compatibility with existing CLAUDE.md instructions
- Use Claude Code's /config command for dynamic configuration changes
- Provide validation consistent with Claude Code's settings validation

### Configuration Categories
- Agent coordination behavior settings (via custom settings.json fields)
- Performance optimization parameters (integrated with Claude Code's env settings)
- Token usage and cost control settings (using Claude Code's existing token management)
- Logging and monitoring configuration (leveraging Claude Code's built-in capabilities)
- Environment-specific settings (using Claude Code's hierarchical configuration levels)

### Claude Code Settings Integration Points
- settings.json format: Standard JSON configuration following Claude Code patterns
- Environment variables: Injected via Claude Code's "env" setting in settings.json
- Configuration hierarchy: Enterprise > User > Project > Local (.local.json) override precedence
- Hot reload: Leveraging Claude Code's /config command for dynamic updates
- Validation: Using Claude Code's built-in configuration validation mechanisms

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Test files located in `tests/configuration/` directory
- Use pytest framework for configuration testing
- Test configuration loading, validation, and hot-reload functionality
- Validate environment variable override behavior
- Test configuration error handling and recovery

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Configuration file parsing accuracy
- Environment variable override precedence
- Settings validation with invalid configurations
- Hot-reload functionality without service interruption
- Default configuration completeness and effectiveness
- Cross-platform environment variable handling
