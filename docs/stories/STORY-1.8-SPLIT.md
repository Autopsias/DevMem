# STORY-1.8 Split Notice

The original STORY-1.8 (Agent Selection and Memory System Optimization) has been split into three smaller, more manageable stories:

1. [STORY-1.8.1: Core Selection Algorithm](STORY-1.8.1-Core-Selection-Algorithm.md)
   - Focus: Core agent selection accuracy improvement to 85%
   - Story Points: 45 SP
   - Duration: 3 weeks
   - Independent foundation story

2. [STORY-1.8.2: Domain Optimization](STORY-1.8.2-Domain-Optimization.md)
   - Focus: Domain-specific accuracy improvements to 92%
   - Story Points: 40 SP
   - Duration: 3 weeks
   - Depends on STORY-1.8.1

3. [STORY-1.8.3: Learning Integration](STORY-1.8.3-Learning-Integration.md)
   - Focus: Self-improving accuracy to 95%+
   - Story Points: 45 SP
   - Duration: 2 weeks
   - Depends on STORY-1.8.1 and 1.8.2

## Reason for Split

The original story was too large (188 SP) and complex for efficient delivery. Breaking it down provides:
- More manageable story sizes (40-45 SP each)
- Clear progression of improvements
- Independent value delivery
- Reduced implementation risk
- Better progress tracking

## Implementation Order

1. Start with STORY-1.8.1 (Core Algorithm)
2. Begin STORY-1.8.2 (Domain) after week 2 of 1.8.1
3. Start STORY-1.8.3 (Learning) when both previous stories near completion

## Original Stories

The original stories have been archived:
- STORY-1.8A-Agent-Selection-Accuracy-Enhancement.md.SPLIT
- STORY-1.8B-Memory-System-Cross-Reference-Optimization.md.SPLIT
- STORY-1.8C-Advanced-Intelligence-Integration.md.SPLIT

DO NOT implement the archived stories. Only implement STORY-1.8.1, 1.8.2, and 1.8.3.
