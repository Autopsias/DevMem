# Story 5.1: Standardize ALL Secondary Agent Protocols

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Claude Code Framework user,
**I want** all 18 secondary agents standardized with hierarchical communication protocols,
**so that** I can leverage sophisticated multi-domain coordination with consistent response patterns and reliable agent synthesis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ALL 18 secondary agents standardized with hierarchical communication response formats
2. Complete secondary agent ecosystem intelligence with no coordination gaps
3. Structured response protocols for primary agent synthesis integration
4. Cross-domain conflict and dependency identification across all secondary agents

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant Source Tree**: `.claude/agents/` - all secondary agent configuration files
- **Pattern Reference**: Follow E4 hierarchical communication architecture established in primary agents
- **Key Context**: This completes the full 34-agent ecosystem (16 primary + 18 secondary)
- **Integration Points**: Must integrate with primary agent synthesis patterns from E4
- **Configuration Standard**: Each agent needs structured response intelligence for primary agent coordination

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/test_agent_standardization.py`
- **Test frameworks**: pytest for agent configuration validation
- **Specific requirements**: Validate all 18 agents have hierarchical communication protocols
- **Integration testing**: Verify primary-secondary agent coordination
