# Story S6.1: Claude Code Performance Optimization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Claude Code Framework user,
**I want** optimized agent coordination performance with prompt caching and token usage optimization,
**so that** I can efficiently use the agent ecosystem without excessive token consumption or coordination delays.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prompt caching system reduces repeated coordination overhead by at least 40%
2. Token usage estimation prevents budget overruns with accurate cost prediction
3. Optimized prompts improve execution efficiency by measurable reduction in response time
4. Agent coordination patterns utilize cached prompts for common operations
5. Token usage tracking provides real-time consumption monitoring
6. Performance metrics demonstrate measurable improvement over baseline
7. Caching system handles agent context transitions efficiently
8. Optimization maintains full functionality of all 34 agents

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements Claude Code-native performance optimizations for the complete 34-agent ecosystem. The optimization targets three key areas: prompt caching for repeated coordination patterns, token usage estimation for cost control, and prompt optimization for execution efficiency.

### Relevant Source Tree
- `.claude/memory/agent-coordination-patterns.md` - Contains agent coordination intelligence
- Agent framework files for 34 specialized agents
- Performance tracking utilities (if existing)
- Claude Code configuration system integration points

### Key Technical Requirements
- Implement caching without breaking agent context isolation
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing agent invocation patterns
- Ensure token estimation accuracy across different model types
- Preserve all agent functionality while optimizing performance

### Performance Baseline Requirements
- Establish baseline metrics before optimization implementation
- Measure cache hit rates and performance improvements
- Track token usage reduction percentages
- Document response time improvements

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Test files located in `tests/performance/` directory
- Use pytest framework for performance testing
- Implement load testing for cache performance under concurrent usage
- Test token estimation accuracy with various prompt types
- Validate cache invalidation works correctly
- Test all 34 agents work properly with optimizations enabled

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Performance benchmarks with before/after comparisons
- Cache effectiveness testing across different usage patterns
- Token estimation accuracy validation
- Agent coordination regression testing
- Memory usage impact assessment
