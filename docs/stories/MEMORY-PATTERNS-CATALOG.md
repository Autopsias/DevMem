# Essential Memory Patterns Catalog for Consolidation

## Purpose
This catalog documents all critical memory patterns that must be preserved when consolidating the 4-file memory system into a simplified 2-file structure:
- `/CLAUDE.md` (project-level coordination)
- `/.claude/memory/agent-coordination-patterns.md` (specialized patterns)

## Architecture Patterns (CRITICAL - Must Preserve)

### Agent Framework Structure
**Status**: 100% complete standardization across 39 agents
- **20 Primary Agents**: Enhanced with UltraThink Analysis + Natural Delegation Integration
- **19 Secondary Agents**: Standardized with "Auto-Activate UltraThink when detecting:" format

### UltraThink Integration Pattern (ESSENTIAL)
```markdown
### UltraThink Analysis (Complex Issues)
**Auto-Activate UltraThink when detecting:**
- "domain" + "complexity" + "systematic" + "coordination" → Systematic domain coordination
- "multi-domain" + "analysis" + "coordination" + "integration" → Multi-domain integration analysis
- "architectural" + "patterns" + "systematic" + "coordination" → Architectural pattern coordination
- "performance" + "optimization" + "coordination" + "systematic" → Performance optimization coordination

### Direct [Domain] Operations (Simple Issues)
- **Basic Operations**: Standard domain-specific operations and simple fixes
- **Direct Implementation**: Basic patterns and straightforward problem resolution
- **Simple Coordination**: Direct specialist engagement for known issues
```
