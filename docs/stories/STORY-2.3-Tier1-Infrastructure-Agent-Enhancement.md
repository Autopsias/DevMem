# STORY 2.3: Tier 1 Infrastructure Agent Enhancement

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: STORY-2.3
- **Epic**: EPIC-2 - Agent Ecosystem Transformation
- **Story Title**: Tier 1 Infrastructure Agent Enhancement
- **Story Owner**: Product Owner
- **Assignee**: Development Team
- **Story Points**: 13
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Sprint**: Sprint 6 (Week 6-7)

## User Story

**As a** framework user  
**I want** infrastructure-engineer, security-enforcer, ci-specialist optimized  
**So that** I get excellent infrastructure support and security validation

## Story Description

Enhance the three critical infrastructure agents responsible for system reliability: infrastructure-engineer (Docker orchestration), security-enforcer (security validation), and ci-specialist (GitHub Actions optimization).

## Business Value

- **Infrastructure Excellence**: Superior Docker orchestration and system analysis
- **Security Assurance**: Enhanced threat detection and compliance validation
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Advanced GitHub Actions analysis and pipeline optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] infrastructure-engineer enhanced with Docker orchestration intelligence
- [ ] security-enforcer optimized with threat detection and compliance patterns
- [ ] ci-specialist enhanced with GitHub Actions optimization capabilities
- [ ] All agents achieve performance targets and natural delegation
- [ ] MCP integration with infrastructure and security intelligence

### Should Have
- [ ] Cross-infrastructure coordination between the three agents
- [ ] Security integration with infrastructure and CI patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization across infrastructure scenarios

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three agents enhanced using standardized template
- [ ] Infrastructure coordination scenarios tested and validated
- [ ] Security patterns integrated across infrastructure and CI
- [ ] Performance targets achieved for infrastructure scenarios

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 2.3.1: infrastructure-engineer Enhancement (4.5 hours)
- Apply enhancement template with Docker orchestration focus
- Integrate container troubleshooting and service networking patterns
- Add MCP integration for infrastructure best practices
- Implement coordination with docker-specialist and performance-optimizer

### Task 2.3.2: security-enforcer Enhancement (4.5 hours)
- Apply enhancement template with security validation focus
- Integrate threat detection and compliance patterns
- Add MCP integration for security intelligence
- Implement coordination with security-auditor for complex scenarios

### Task 2.3.3: ci-specialist Enhancement (4 hours)
- Apply enhancement template with CI/CD optimization focus
- Integrate GitHub Actions analysis and pipeline optimization
- Add MCP integration for CI best practices
- Implement coordination with workflow-optimizer and environment-synchronizer

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Infrastructure coordination: >90% effectiveness for Docker and deployment scenarios
- [ ] Security validation: >95% threat detection and compliance accuracy
- [ ] CI optimization: Measurable pipeline performance improvements

## Notes & Comments

**Infrastructure Notes**: Focus on practical infrastructure improvements that directly benefit development productivity and system reliability.
