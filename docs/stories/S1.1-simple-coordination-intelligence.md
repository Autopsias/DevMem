# ðŸ“‹ **Story 1.1: Simple Coordination Intelligence**

**Story ID**: S1.1  
**Epic**: E1 - Claude Code Optimization Foundation  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Estimated Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Ready for Development  

## **User Story**
**As a** system architect  
**I want** intelligent batching for multi-agent coordination  
**So that** we optimize performance within Claude Code's execution model

## **Business Value**
Enables intelligent coordination decisions that prevent system overload while optimizing multi-agent execution through research-validated batching patterns.

## **Tasks**
- [ ] Create `/scripts/claude_code_coordination_optimizer.py`
- [ ] Implement `optimize_task_batch_size()` method with research-validated 4-agent batches
- [ ] Add `suggest_coordination_pattern()` for domain-based routing
- [ ] Implement `get_best_agents_for_domains()` with compatibility mapping
- [ ] Add coordination strategy logic (single_parallel vs batch_parallel)

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Intelligent batching for >6 agent coordination requests
- âœ… Optimal batch size selection (research-validated 4-agent batches)
- âœ… Domain-aware agent selection with compatibility consideration

## **Technical Requirements**
- Python script with coordination optimization logic
- Research-validated 4-agent batch optimization
- Domain-based routing intelligence
- Compatibility mapping between agents
- Strategy selection logic for coordination approaches

## **Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: None - foundation story
- **Blocks**: Story 2.1 (Native Claude Code Parallel Execution) needs this optimization layer

## **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Script created at specified path
- [ ] All methods implemented and tested
- [ ] Intelligent batching working for >6 agents
- [ ] Domain-aware selection operational
- [ ] Code reviewed and documented

## **Testing Notes**
- Test with various agent count scenarios (2, 4, 6, 8, 10+ agents)
- Validate batch size optimization logic
- Verify domain routing accuracy
- Test compatibility mapping functionality

## **Notes**
- Foundation for all coordination intelligence
- Research-validated patterns integrated
- Keep implementation simple but effective
