## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the replacement configuration system after removing the complex 3,709-line configuration/ directory. The goal is to achieve equivalent functionality using Claude Code native patterns with significantly reduced complexity.

### Claude Code Native Configuration Approach
**Single Configuration File**: .claude/settings.json
- Replaces multi-file configuration hierarchy with single authoritative source
- Uses Claude Code native JSON schema and validation
- Leverages Claude Code platform configuration loading and caching
- Enables Claude Code native hot-reload and configuration management

**Native Pattern Integration**:
- Agent coordination settings aligned with Anthropic agent architecture standards
- Memory hierarchy configuration using Claude Code native memory patterns  
- Hook configuration streamlined to essential security and quality enforcement
- Performance settings optimized for Claude Code platform capabilities

### Configuration Migration Strategy
**From Complex Hierarchy → To Native Single File**:
- configuration/agents/ → .claude/settings.json "agents" section
- configuration/memory/ → .claude/settings.json "memory" section  
- configuration/performance/ → .claude/settings.json "performance" section
- configuration/hooks/ → .claude/settings.json "hooks" section

**Simplification Principles**:
- Eliminate configuration redundancy and over-engineering
- Use Claude Code platform defaults where possible
- Focus on essential configuration only
- Leverage Claude Code native validation and error handling

### Critical Configuration Areas
**Agent Coordination**:
- Natural selection patterns and preferences
- Parallel execution configuration and limits
- Sequential intelligence and context preservation settings
- Meta-orchestration and escalation triggers

**Memory Management**:
- Simplified 2-file memory hierarchy (from 5-hop)
- Memory pattern preferences and learning integration
- Context accumulation and preservation settings

**Performance & Quality**:
- Essential performance monitoring configuration
- Streamlined hook configuration for security and quality
- Quality gate thresholds and enforcement settings

### Testing Standards
- **Configuration Testing**: Validate all configuration elements load and apply correctly
- **Performance Testing**: Verify configuration loading meets performance requirements
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure compatibility with Claude Code platform features
- **Validation Testing**: Test configuration validation catches errors appropriately
- **Migration Testing**: Verify migration from old to new configuration works correctly
