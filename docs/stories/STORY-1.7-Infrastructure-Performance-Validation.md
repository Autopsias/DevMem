## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story provides the final validation that Epic-1's infrastructure simplification has achieved its goals without performance regression. It validates the complete infrastructure transformation: Python infrastructure removal (~7,058 lines), hook consolidation (~1,867 lines → essential hooks), memory system consolidation (7 files → 2 files), and native configuration migration. It serves as the quality gate for Epic-1 completion and transition to Epic-2.

### Performance Validation Strategy
**Comprehensive Performance Testing**:
- Baseline measurement before any infrastructure changes
- Continuous performance monitoring during infrastructure simplification phases
- Final comprehensive performance validation after all changes complete
- Comparison analysis to validate performance targets achieved

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- **Agent Selection Time**: ≤1s requirement (critical framework responsiveness)
- **Memory System Performance**: Lookup time, coordination accuracy, context preservation
- **Hook System Performance**: Execution time impact, security/quality enforcement speed
- **Configuration Performance**: Loading time, application speed, native integration speed
- **Overall Framework Responsiveness**: End-to-end user experience and system responsiveness

### Critical Performance Requirements
**Framework Responsiveness Requirements**:
- Agent selection must complete within ≤1s consistently
- Memory-driven coordination accuracy must maintain >95%
- Sequential coordination context preservation must maintain >91%
- Essential security and quality enforcement must have minimal performance impact

**Infrastructure Simplification Performance Targets** (Per Epic-1):
- Performance maintained or improved despite massive infrastructure reduction:
  - Python infrastructure: ~7,058 lines removed
  - Hook scripts: ~1,867 lines → essential hooks only  
  - Memory system: 7 files → 2 files consolidated
  - Native configuration: .claude/settings.json migration
- Claude Code sub-agent system (39 agents) functionality completely preserved
- All performance targets achieved while maintaining Anthropic standards compliance

### Performance Monitoring Approach
**Lightweight Monitoring**: Use simplified infrastructure for ongoing performance tracking
- Leverage Claude Code native performance insights where available
- Implement minimal performance tracking aligned with simplified infrastructure goals
- Focus on critical performance indicators only
- Avoid recreating complex performance monitoring infrastructure

### Epic-1 Success Validation ✅ **VERIFIED TARGETS**
This story serves as the final gate for Epic-1 completion:
- **Massive Infrastructure Reduction**: Validate reduction achieved:
  - Python infrastructure: ~7,058 lines removed (Stories 1.2-1.3)

  - Memory system: 7 files → 2 files (Story 1.5)
  - Total simplification while preserving Claude Code sub-agent system (39 agents)
- **Zero Functionality Regression**: Confirm all essential functionality preserved (especially .claude/agents/)
- **Performance Maintained**: Validate ≤1s agent selection and framework responsiveness (Epic-1 requirement)
- **Anthropic Compliance**: Confirm complete Claude Code standards compliance with native patterns
