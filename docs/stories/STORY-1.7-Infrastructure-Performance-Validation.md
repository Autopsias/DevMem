2. Measure performance metrics after infrastructure simplification completion
3. Validate ≤1s agent selection time requirement met with simplified infrastructure
4. Confirm no performance regression in critical framework operations
5. Validate memory system performance maintained or improved with 2-file consolidation
6. Document performance improvements achieved through infrastructure simplification
7. Create performance monitoring procedures for ongoing simplified infrastructure health
8. Validate performance meets Epic 1 success criteria and framework requirements

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story provides the final validation that Epic 1's infrastructure simplification has achieved its goals without performance regression. It serves as the quality gate for Epic 1 completion and transition to Epic 2.

### Performance Validation Strategy
**Comprehensive Performance Testing**:
- Baseline measurement before any infrastructure changes
- Continuous performance monitoring during infrastructure simplification phases
- Final comprehensive performance validation after all changes complete
- Comparison analysis to validate performance targets achieved

**Key Performance Indicators**:
- **Agent Selection Time**: ≤1s requirement (critical framework responsiveness)
- **Memory System Performance**: Lookup time, coordination accuracy, context preservation
- **Hook System Performance**: Execution time impact, security/quality enforcement speed
- **Configuration Performance**: Loading time, application speed, native integration speed
- **Overall Framework Responsiveness**: End-to-end user experience and system responsiveness

### Critical Performance Requirements
**Framework Responsiveness Requirements**:
- Agent selection must complete within ≤1s consistently
- Memory-driven coordination accuracy must maintain >95%
- Sequential coordination context preservation must maintain >91%
- Essential security and quality enforcement must have minimal performance impact

**Infrastructure Simplification Performance Targets**:
- Performance maintained or improved despite 90% infrastructure code reduction
- Memory system performance maintained or improved with 2-file consolidation
- Hook system performance improved through streamlining to essentials only
- Configuration performance improved through native Claude Code patterns

### Performance Monitoring Approach
**Lightweight Monitoring**: Use simplified infrastructure for ongoing performance tracking
- Leverage Claude Code native performance insights where available
- Implement minimal performance tracking aligned with simplified infrastructure goals
- Focus on critical performance indicators only
- Avoid recreating complex performance monitoring infrastructure

### Epic 1 Success Validation
This story serves as the final gate for Epic 1 completion:
- **90% Infrastructure Reduction**: Validate code reduction from 7,000+ lines to <500 lines
- **Zero Functionality Regression**: Confirm all essential functionality preserved
- **Performance Maintained**: Validate ≤1s agent selection and framework responsiveness
- **Anthropic Compliance**: Confirm complete Claude Code standards compliance

### Testing Standards
- **Performance Testing**: Comprehensive performance measurement and validation
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure no performance degradation from infrastructure changes
- **Load Testing**: Validate performance under various usage scenarios
- **Comparative Analysis**: Before/after performance comparison and analysis
- **Epic Validation**: Confirm Epic 1 success criteria achieved
