# STORY 2.5: Secondary Agent Standardization (19 agents)

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: STORY-2.5
- **Epic**: EPIC-2 - Agent Ecosystem Transformation
- **Story Title**: Secondary Agent Standardization - 19 agents
- **Story Owner**: Product Owner
- **Assignee**: Development Team
- **Story Points**: 21
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Sprint**: Sprint 9-10 (Week 9-11)

## User Story

**As a** framework user  
**I want** all 19 secondary agents enhanced with coordination intelligence  
**So that** I get sophisticated domain-specific expertise when needed

## Story Description

Enhance all 19 secondary agents using the proven enhancement template and coordination patterns. These agents provide specialized domain expertise and are typically coordinated by primary agents for complex scenarios.

## Target Agent Domains (19 total)

### Development Quality (5 agents)
- async-pattern-fixer, type-system-expert, mock-configuration-expert, validation-tester, linting-engineer

### Infrastructure & Performance (4 agents)
- docker-specialist, performance-optimizer, resource-optimizer, environment-synchronizer

### Architecture & Security (4 agents)
- security-auditor, pattern-analyzer, refactoring-coordinator, dependency-resolver

### Testing & Integration (5 agents)
- coverage-optimizer, fixture-design-specialist, integration-validator, configuration-validator, workflow-optimizer

### Additional Domain (1 agent)
- file-size-enforcer

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] All 19 secondary agents enhanced using standardized template
- [ ] Specialized domain expertise preserved and enhanced
- [ ] Coordination patterns with primary agents implemented
- [ ] Natural delegation triggers for secondary agent activation
- [ ] MCP integration where beneficial for domain expertise

### Should Have
- [ ] Cross-secondary agent coordination for complex scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization for specialized operations
- [ ] Domain-specific intelligence and capabilities enhanced

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 19 agents meet secondary agent enhancement standards
- [ ] Coordination with primary agents tested and validated
- [ ] Specialized domain capabilities enhanced and documented
- [ ] Secondary agent ecosystem functioning cohesively

## Tasks Breakdown (Split across 2 sprints)

### Sprint 9 Tasks (Week 9-10): First 10 Agents
- **Development Quality Batch** (5 hours): 5 development quality agents
- **Infrastructure Batch** (5 hours): 4 infrastructure + 1 additional agent

### Sprint 10 Tasks (Week 10-11): Second 9 Agents
- **Architecture & Security Batch** (5 hours): 4 architecture & security agents  
- **Testing & Integration Batch** (5 hours): 5 testing & integration agents
- **Final Validation** (1 hour): Complete secondary agent ecosystem testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Secondary agent enhancement: All 19 agents enhanced to standards
- [ ] Domain expertise: Specialized capabilities maintained and improved
- [ ] Primary coordination: >90% effective coordination with primary agents
- [ ] Ecosystem coherence: Secondary agents work together effectively

## Notes & Comments

**Specialization Focus**: Maintain and enhance domain-specific expertise while ensuring consistent coordination patterns.

**Coordination Intelligence**: Ensure secondary agents integrate seamlessly with primary agent coordination scenarios.
