# STORY-2.3: Performance Optimization
Status: Ready for Development ✅ (Validated by PO and SM)

## Story Details
- **Points**: 10
- **Epic**: EPIC-2 Agent Ecosystem Optimization Excellence
- **Status**: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
- **Estimated Effort**: 40 hours (1.25 weeks single developer)
- **Timeline Position**: Sequential after STORY-2.1 completion (Week 5)
- **Dependencies**: STORY-2.1 (delegation patterns), STORY-2.1C (memory integration)

## User Story
As a framework user,
I want optimized performance for high-impact coordination agents
So that I experience faster response times and better resource utilization

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Reduce memory access time to <25ms (from current baseline)
2. Optimize agent selection time to 0.8s average
3. Maintain 97% context preservation during transitions
4. Implement intelligent batching for Task() parallel execution
5. Add real-time performance monitoring
6. Optimize cross-domain coordination to >95% success rate
7. Add performance regression tests

## Epic Integration and Dependencies

### EPIC-2 Story Dependencies
- **STORY-2.1A (Critical Dependency)**: Requires completed and stable delegation patterns for optimization baseline
- **STORY-2.1B (Framework Dependency)**: Needs operational confidence scoring framework for performance measurement
- **STORY-2.1C (Memory Dependency)**: Memory integration must be complete for <25ms optimization target
- **STORY-2.2 (Parallel Integration)**: MCP integration performance targets must align with overall optimization goals

### Performance Optimization Strategy
- **Baseline Establishment**: Use STORY-2.1 performance baselines for improvement measurement
- **Memory Optimization**: Build upon STORY-2.1C memory integration for <25ms access time
- **Agent Selection**: Optimize existing agent selection from current 0.8s baseline
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain or improve 97% context preservation rate
- **Parallel Execution**: Enhance Task() parallel patterns from STORY-2.1A

### Timeline Integration
- **Week 5**: Begin after STORY-2.1 completion validation
- **Week 5-6**: Core performance optimization implementation
- **Week 6**: Integration with STORY-2.2 MCP patterns
- **Week 6**: Performance validation and monitoring setup

## Technical Notes
- Focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 agents (from coordination-hub.md classification)
- Implement performance benchmarking building on STORY-2.1 baselines
- Add monitoring instrumentation compatible with STORY-2.4 validation framework
- Maintain current compliance levels (≥95% Anthropic compliance)
- Follow validation framework requirements established in STORY-2.1
- Leverage existing high-performance agent patterns from coordination-hub.md
