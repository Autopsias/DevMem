# STORY 2.4: Primary Agent Batch Enhancement (14 agents)

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: STORY-2.4
- **Epic**: EPIC-2 - Agent Ecosystem Transformation
- **Story Title**: Primary Agent Batch Enhancement - 14 agents
- **Story Owner**: Product Owner
- **Assignee**: Development Team
- **Story Points**: 21
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Sprint**: Sprint 7-8 (Week 7-9)

## User Story

**As a** framework user  
**I want** remaining 14 primary agents enhanced to best-in-class standards  
**So that** I get comprehensive domain expertise across all development areas

## Story Description

Enhance the remaining 14 primary agents using the validated enhancement template and patterns established in previous stories. These agents provide core framework functionality across development, intelligence, and coordination domains.

## Target Agents (14 total)

### Development Support (4 agents)
- git-commit-assistant, agent-reviewer, agent-creator, lint-enforcer

### Intelligence & Enhancement (3 agents)  
- intelligent-enhancer, framework-coordinator, synthesis-coordinator

### Specialized Coordination (3 agents)
- token-monitor, user-feedback-coordinator, architecture-validator

### Framework Architecture & Health (4 agents)
- health-monitor, code-quality-specialist, environment-analyst, digdeep

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] All 14 agents enhanced using standardized template
- [ ] Anthropic compliance achieved for all agents
- [ ] Natural delegation patterns implemented
- [ ] MCP integration with progressive enhancement
- [ ] Cross-domain coordination patterns validated

### Should Have
- [ ] Performance optimization across all enhanced agents
- [ ] Domain-specific coordination intelligence
- [ ] Error handling and fallback patterns implemented

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 14 agents meet enhancement standards
- [ ] Performance targets achieved across agent batch
- [ ] Coordination patterns tested between agents
- [ ] Documentation updated for enhanced agents

## Tasks Breakdown (Split across 2 sprints)

### Sprint 7 Tasks (Week 7-8): First 7 Agents
- **Batch 1A** (3.5 hours): intelligent-enhancer, framework-coordinator, synthesis-coordinator
- **Batch 1B** (3.5 hours): git-commit-assistant, agent-reviewer, agent-creator  
- **Batch 1C** (3.5 hours): lint-enforcer + coordination testing

### Sprint 8 Tasks (Week 8-9): Second 7 Agents  
- **Batch 2A** (3.5 hours): token-monitor, user-feedback-coordinator, architecture-validator
- **Batch 2B** (3.5 hours): health-monitor, code-quality-specialist, environment-analyst
- **Batch 2C** (3.5 hours): digdeep + batch validation and testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Enhancement completion: All 14 agents enhanced to standards
- [ ] Performance: <1s response time average across agent batch
- [ ] Natural delegation: >95% appropriate agent selection
- [ ] Coordination: >90% effectiveness for multi-domain scenarios

## Notes & Comments

**Batch Processing**: Use lessons learned from Tier 1 agents to efficiently process these 14 agents while maintaining quality standards.

**Quality Focus**: Maintain enhancement template consistency while allowing for domain-specific optimizations.
