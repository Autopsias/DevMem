# Story 1.1: Infrastructure Assessment & Backup

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** framework maintainer,
**I want** comprehensive assessment and backup of current infrastructure systems,
**so that** I can safely proceed with infrastructure simplification while maintaining rollback capability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Complete inventory of infrastructure components created (configuration/, performance/, validation scripts)
2. Full backup of existing infrastructure code created and validated
3. Baseline performance metrics captured for comparison
4. Risk assessment completed for each infrastructure component
5. Rollback procedures documented and tested
6. Infrastructure dependencies mapped and documented

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Inventory Current Infrastructure (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Catalog configuration/ directory contents (3,709 lines)
  - [ ] Catalog performance/ directory contents (3,349 lines)
  - [ ] Catalog validation script functionality
  - [ ] Document current hook system configuration
  - [ ] Map memory hierarchy structure (current 5-hop system)

- [ ] Create Comprehensive Backup (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create git branch backup-pre-infrastructure-simplification
  - [ ] Create compressed archive of infrastructure directories
  - [ ] Validate backup integrity and completeness
  - [ ] Store backup in secure location with access documentation

- [ ] Capture Baseline Metrics (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Measure current agent selection time performance
  - [ ] Measure memory system response times
  - [ ] Capture configuration loading times
  - [ ] Document current resource utilization
  - [ ] Record current reliability metrics

- [ ] Risk Assessment (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Assess removal impact for each infrastructure component
  - [ ] Identify critical vs. non-critical functionality
  - [ ] Document potential failure points during removal
  - [ ] Identify external dependencies that may be affected

- [ ] Rollback Planning (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Document step-by-step rollback procedures
  - [ ] Create rollback automation scripts where possible
  - [ ] Test rollback procedures in safe environment
  - [ ] Define rollback decision criteria and triggers

- [ ] Dependency Mapping (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Map infrastructure component interdependencies
  - [ ] Identify external system touchpoints
  - [ ] Document Claude Code platform dependencies
  - [ ] Create dependency removal sequence plan

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundation for Epic 1's infrastructure simplification. The DevMem agent framework currently contains over 7,000 lines of over-engineered infrastructure that needs systematic removal while preserving core functionality.

### Current Infrastructure Components
- **configuration/ directory**: 3,709 lines of complex configuration management
- **performance/ directory**: 3,349 lines of performance monitoring systems  
- **validation scripts**: Various quality assurance and validation tools
- **5-hop memory hierarchy**: Complex memory system with multiple recursion levels
- **Hook system**: Currently extensive, needs streamlining to essentials only

### Critical Success Factors
- Zero functionality loss during transition
- Performance maintained or improved (â‰¤1s agent selection time)
- Complete Anthropic standards compliance achieved
- Safe rollback capability at all stages

### Risk Mitigation Approach
- Incremental assessment and backup approach
- Comprehensive testing of backup procedures before any removal
- Performance baseline establishment for objective comparison
- Detailed dependency mapping to avoid cascade failures

### Testing Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain current coverage levels during infrastructure changes
- **Integration Testing**: Validate backup/restore procedures work correctly
- **Performance Testing**: Baseline metrics captured for comparative analysis
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality preserved throughout process
