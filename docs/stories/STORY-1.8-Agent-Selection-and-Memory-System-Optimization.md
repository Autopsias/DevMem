   python -m scripts.memory_system_backup --verify-completeness
   ```

**Rollback Execution Procedures**:

```bash
# Emergency rollback for critical performance degradation
./scripts/emergency_rollback.sh --immediate --preserve-data
git checkout tags/pre-optimization-stable
systemctl restart claude-code-framework
python -m scripts.health_check --critical-only --timeout=10
```

**Phase 2: Gradual Traffic Reduction** (5-10 minutes):
```bash
# Gradually reduce traffic to optimized system
./scripts/traffic_manager.sh --reduce-optimized --percentage=75
sleep 60
./scripts/traffic_manager.sh --reduce-optimized --percentage=50
sleep 60
./scripts/traffic_manager.sh --reduce-optimized --percentage=25
sleep 60
./scripts/traffic_manager.sh --route-all-baseline
```

**Phase 3: Full System Rollback** (10-15 minutes):
