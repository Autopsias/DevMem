# ðŸ“‹ **Story 2.1: Native Claude Code Parallel Execution**

**Story ID**: S2.1  
**Epic**: E2 - True Parallel Execution Core  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Ready for Development  

## **User Story**
**As a** framework developer  
**I want** true parallel execution using multiple Task() calls  
**So that** agents run simultaneously within Claude Code's native capabilities

## **Business Value**
Enables true simultaneous agent execution, dramatically improving performance for multi-domain problems while maintaining Claude Code's native execution model and resource constraints.

## **Tasks**
- [ ] Research and document Claude Code's 10-agent parallel limit
- [ ] Create multiple Task() call patterns for 2-4 domain problems
- [ ] Implement single-batch execution for â‰¤6 agents
- [ ] Add batch parallel execution for >6 agents with optimization integration
- [ ] Create coordination ID tracking and performance logging
- [ ] Integrate with ClaudeCodeCoordinationOptimizer for intelligent batching
- [ ] Add resource validation before execution

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Multiple Task() calls in single message trigger true parallel execution
- âœ… Intelligent batching for >6 agent coordinations with research-validated batches
- âœ… Resource awareness prevents system overload
- âœ… Each agent completes independently with separate context windows
- âœ… Results synthesis occurs after all parallel agents complete
- âœ… Performance tracking enables continuous improvement

## **Technical Requirements**
- Multiple Task() call implementation within single message
- Integration with Epic 1 optimization layer
- Resource validation using resource tracker
- Coordination ID system for tracking relationships
- Performance logging for all parallel executions
- Batch execution logic for large coordinations

## **Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: E1 must be complete (requires all optimization layer components)
- **Blocks**: E3 (Framework Critical Fixes) requires parallel execution capability

## **Claude Code Integration Points**
- **Native Task() Calls**: Multiple Task() invocations in single message
- **10-Agent Limit**: Claude Code's maximum parallel execution constraint
- **Independent Context**: Each agent operates in separate context window
- **Resource Constraints**: Integration with Claude Code's resource management

## **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Research documentation complete for Claude Code parallel limits
- [ ] Multiple Task() call patterns implemented and tested
- [ ] Single-batch and batch parallel execution operational
- [ ] Integration with optimization layer working
- [ ] Coordination ID tracking functional
- [ ] Performance logging capturing all parallel executions
- [ ] Resource validation preventing overload
- [ ] End-to-end parallel execution tested and validated

## **Testing Scenarios**
- 2-agent parallel execution test
- 4-agent parallel execution test  
- 6-agent parallel execution test
- 8-agent parallel execution test
- 10-agent parallel execution test (Claude Code's maximum)
- >10-agent batch execution test with intelligent batching

## **Notes**
- Core functionality for entire parallel framework
- Critical integration point with Claude Code's native capabilities
- Foundation for all subsequent agent coordination
