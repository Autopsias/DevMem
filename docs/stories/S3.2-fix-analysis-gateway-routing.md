# ðŸ”€ **STORY 3.2: FIX ANALYSIS-GATEWAY ROUTING**

**Story ID**: S3.2  
**Epic**: E3 - Framework Critical Fixes  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: High  
**Sprint**: TBD  

## **User Story**

As a **Claude Code Framework user**,  
I want **analysis-gateway to use direct Task() calls for multi-domain problems**,  
So that **I get efficient routing to appropriate agents without unnecessary meta-coordinator overhead**.

## **Story Context**

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: analysis-gateway agent routing logic and Task() execution system
- Technology: Python agent routing with direct Task() calls
- Follows pattern: Direct agent dispatch patterns established in E2 parallel execution core
- Touch points: analysis-gateway routing logic, meta-coordinator usage boundaries

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **analysis-gateway uses direct Task() calls** for 2-4 domain problems instead of routing through meta-coordinator
2. **meta-coordinator reserved exclusively** for 5+ domain strategic coordination problems
3. **Routing logic clearly differentiates** between direct coordination (2-4 domains) and strategic coordination (5+ domains)

### **Integration Requirements:**

4. **Existing meta-coordinator functionality** continues to work unchanged for 5+ domain problems
5. **New direct routing** follows existing Task() call patterns from parallel execution implementation
6. **Integration with synthesis-coordinator** maintains current result aggregation behavior

### **Quality Requirements:**

7. **Routing changes are covered** by comprehensive tests for both direct and strategic coordination paths
8. **Routing logic documentation updated** to clearly specify when each coordination approach is used
9. **No regression in existing** coordination functionality verified through end-to-end testing

## **Technical Implementation Tasks**

### **Routing Logic Updates**
- [ ] **Update analysis-gateway routing logic** to use direct Task() calls for 2-4 domain problems
- [ ] **Implement domain count detection** to automatically choose between direct and strategic coordination
- [ ] **Create routing decision matrix** specifying coordination approach by domain count and complexity

### **Direct Task() Implementation**
- [ ] **Implement direct Task() execution** for common multi-domain combinations (2-4 domains)
- [ ] **Create standardized Task() templates** for frequent domain coordination patterns
- [ ] **Add parallel execution support** for direct multi-domain Task() calls

### **Meta-Coordinator Boundary Management**
- [ ] **Update meta-coordinator usage criteria** to trigger only for 5+ domain strategic coordination
- [ ] **Refactor existing meta-coordinator calls** that should use direct routing
- [ ] **Validate meta-coordinator performance** for appropriate strategic coordination scenarios

### **Integration and Testing**
- [ ] **Test direct routing paths** for common 2-4 domain problem scenarios
- [ ] **Validate meta-coordinator boundaries** ensure 5+ domain problems still route correctly
- [ ] **Performance test routing efficiency** compare direct vs strategic coordination latency

## **Routing Decision Matrix**

### **Direct Task() Coordination (2-4 domains)**
- **Testing + Performance + Security**: Direct Task() calls to test-specialist, performance-optimizer, security-enforcer
- **Infrastructure + Docker + Environment**: Direct Task() calls to infrastructure-engineer, docker-specialist, environment-analyst
- **Code Quality + Security + Performance**: Direct Task() calls to code-quality-specialist, security-auditor, performance-optimizer
- **CI + Testing + Quality**: Direct Task() calls to ci-specialist, test-specialist, code-quality-specialist

### **Meta-Coordinator Strategic Coordination (5+ domains)**
- **Complex System Architecture**: 5+ domains requiring strategic orchestration
- **Cross-System Integration**: Multiple system boundaries with coordination complexity
- **Crisis Response Scenarios**: Emergency situations requiring comprehensive coordination
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term architectural decisions affecting multiple domains

## **Technical Requirements**

- **Domain Detection Logic**: Automatic detection of domain count and complexity for routing decisions
- **Direct Task() Templates**: Standardized templates for common multi-domain coordination patterns  
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced latency for 2-4 domain problems through direct routing
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Clear criteria preventing inappropriate meta-coordinator usage
- **Integration Validation**: Ensure synthesis-coordinator works with both routing approaches

## **Integration Approach**

### **Phase 1: Routing Logic Implementation**
- Update analysis-gateway with domain detection and routing decision logic
- Implement direct Task() call infrastructure for multi-domain coordination

### **Phase 2: Template Development**  
- Create standardized Task() templates for common domain combinations
- Implement parallel execution support for direct multi-domain calls

### **Phase 3: Meta-Coordinator Boundary Management**
- Update meta-coordinator usage criteria and triggers
- Refactor existing inappropriate meta-coordinator usage

### **Phase 4: Testing and Validation**
- Comprehensive testing of both direct and strategic coordination paths
- Performance validation and optimization

## **Definition of Done**

- [ ] analysis-gateway uses direct Task() calls for 2-4 domain problems
- [ ] meta-coordinator reserved exclusively for 5+ domain strategic coordination
- [ ] Routing decision logic implemented with clear domain count and complexity criteria
- [ ] Direct Task() templates created for common multi-domain coordination patterns
- [ ] Existing meta-coordinator functionality verified unchanged for appropriate scenarios
- [ ] Performance improvement demonstrated for 2-4 domain problems
- [ ] Comprehensive testing covers both routing paths
- [ ] Documentation updated with clear routing criteria and usage guidelines

## **Performance Targets**

- **Direct Routing Latency**: <1.5s for 2-4 domain problems (vs current meta-coordinator overhead)
- **Strategic Coordination**: Maintain current meta-coordinator performance for 5+ domain problems
- **Routing Decision Time**: <0.1s for domain detection and routing choice
- **Context Preservation**: >95% context retention through direct routing

## **Risk Mitigation**

**Primary Risk**: Breaking existing coordination workflows during routing logic changes
**Mitigation**: Phased implementation with extensive testing of both routing paths
**Rollback Plan**: Feature flag system to revert to original routing logic if issues arise

## **Success Metrics**

- **Routing Efficiency**: 40-60% latency reduction for 2-4 domain problems
- **Appropriate Usage**: meta-coordinator used only for 5+ domain strategic scenarios
- **Context Quality**: No degradation in coordination context quality
- **Integration Success**: synthesis-coordinator works effectively with both routing approaches
- **Performance Consistency**: Reliable performance across different domain combinations
