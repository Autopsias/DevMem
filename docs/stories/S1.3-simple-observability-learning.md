**Story ID**: S1.3  
**Epic**: E1 - Claude Code Optimization Foundation  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Estimated Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Done  

## **User Story**
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** basic coordination tracking  
**So that** the system learns and improves over time

## **Business Value**
Establishes foundation for continuous improvement through pattern learning and performance analytics, enabling the system to optimize coordination decisions over time.

## **Tasks**
- [x] Create `/scripts/claude_code_coordination_tracker.py`
- [x] Implement coordination logging with start/complete tracking
- [x] Add success pattern learning with simple analytics
- [x] Create insights generation for performance recommendations
- [x] Implement basic pattern recognition for improvement

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Simple coordination tracking without complexity
- âœ… Pattern learning for continuous improvement
- âœ… Basic analytics and recommendations

## **Technical Requirements**
- Python script with coordination tracking capabilities
- Start/complete logging for coordination events
- Success pattern analysis and learning
- Insights generation for performance optimization
- Basic pattern recognition algorithms

## **Dependencies**
