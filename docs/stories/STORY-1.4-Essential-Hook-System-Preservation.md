- [ ] Hook error handling and reliability validation
- [ ] Hook integration with simplified infrastructure validated

### Could Have
- [ ] Hook monitoring and logging for troubleshooting
- [ ] Hook performance metrics and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Hook backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Hook configuration management best practices

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Essential hooks preserved and functional
- [ ] Non-essential hooks removed completely
- [ ] Hook configuration updated and tested
- [ ] All quality and security enforcement working
- [ ] Hook documentation updated
- [ ] Team training on streamlined hook system completed

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1.4.1: Non-Essential Hook Removal (1 hour)
- Remove scripts/hooks/environment_bridge.sh
- Remove scripts/hooks/lightweight_validator.sh  
- Remove scripts/hooks/notification.sh
- Remove scripts/hooks/subagent_dispatcher.sh
- Clean up any references to removed hooks

### Task 1.4.2: Essential Hook Validation (1.5 hours)
- Test bash_security.sh functionality and performance
- Test code_quality_enforcer.sh functionality and performance
- Verify hooks work with simplified infrastructure
- Update hook configuration in settings.json

### Task 1.4.3: Hook Documentation Update (0.5 hours)
- Update documentation to reflect streamlined hook system
- Document essential hook purposes and functionality
- Create hook troubleshooting guide
- Update team procedures for hook management

## Technical Requirements

### Essential Hooks to Preserve
- **bash_security.sh**: Security validation for bash commands
  - Purpose: Prevent execution of potentially dangerous commands
  - Trigger: PreToolUse hook for Bash tools
  - Critical: Security enforcement cannot be compromised

- **code_quality_enforcer.sh**: Code quality validation after file changes
  - Purpose: Enforce code quality standards and formatting
  - Trigger: PostToolUse hook for Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools
  - Critical: Maintain code quality standards

### Hooks to Remove
- **environment_bridge.sh**: Environment coordination (complex, non-essential)
- **lightweight_validator.sh**: Additional validation (redundant with quality enforcer)
- **notification.sh**: Notification system (non-essential complexity)
- **subagent_dispatcher.sh**: Agent dispatching (replaced by natural delegation)

### Hook Configuration Integration
- Update .claude/settings.json to reflect only essential hooks
- Ensure hook paths are correct and accessible
- Validate hook execution permissions and security

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **STORY-1.3**: Claude Code native configuration must be completed
- **Essential Hook Scripts**: bash_security.sh and code_quality_enforcer.sh must exist and function

### External Dependencies
- Claude Code platform hook support
- File system permissions for hook execution

## Risks & Mitigation

### Medium Risk
- **Security Degradation Risk**: Removing hooks compromises security
  - *Mitigation*: Preserve all security-critical hooks, validate security enforcement after changes

### Low Risk
- **Quality Degradation Risk**: Code quality enforcement weakened
  - *Mitigation*: Preserve code quality hooks, test quality enforcement thoroughly

## Testing Strategy

### Hook Functionality Testing
- **Security Hook Testing**: Test bash_security.sh with various command scenarios
- **Quality Hook Testing**: Test code_quality_enforcer.sh with different file changes
- **Integration Testing**: Verify hooks work with simplified infrastructure
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure hook execution is efficient

### System Integration Testing
- **Framework Integration**: Verify framework operates correctly with streamlined hooks
- **Agent Integration**: Test agent operations trigger appropriate hooks
- **Quality Validation**: Verify code quality standards are maintained
- **Security Validation**: Verify security enforcement is preserved

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Hook count reduced: From 6 hooks to 2 essential hooks
- [ ] Security enforcement: 100% security validation preserved
- [ ] Quality enforcement: 100% code quality standards maintained
- [ ] Performance: Hook execution time optimized or improved
- [ ] Functionality: No degradation in essential hook functionality

## Hook Removal Checklist

### Pre-Removal Validation
- [ ] Identify all hooks and their purposes
- [ ] Classify hooks as essential vs non-essential
- [ ] Verify essential hooks are fully functional
- [ ] Document removed hook functionality for reference

### Removal Process
- [ ] Remove environment_bridge.sh and all references
- [ ] Remove lightweight_validator.sh and all references
- [ ] Remove notification.sh and all references
- [ ] Remove subagent_dispatcher.sh and all references
- [ ] Update configuration to reference only essential hooks

### Post-Removal Validation
- [ ] Test essential hooks still function correctly
- [ ] Verify no references to removed hooks remain
- [ ] Validate framework functionality with streamlined hooks
- [ ] Confirm security and quality enforcement unchanged

## Essential Hook Documentation

### bash_security.sh
- **Purpose**: Validate bash commands for security risks
- **Trigger**: Before bash command execution (PreToolUse)
- **Function**: Prevent execution of potentially dangerous commands
- **Critical**: Cannot be removed without compromising security

### code_quality_enforcer.sh  
- **Purpose**: Enforce code quality standards after file modifications
- **Trigger**: After file edit/write operations (PostToolUse)
- **Function**: Run formatting, linting, and quality checks
- **Critical**: Essential for maintaining code quality standards

## Notes & Comments

**Simplification Notes**: Focus on preserving only the hooks that provide essential value. Remove anything that adds complexity without critical functionality.

**Security Notes**: Never compromise security enforcement. If in doubt about a security-related hook, preserve it and evaluate later.

**Quality Notes**: Code quality enforcement is essential for framework maintainability. Preserve all quality-related functionality.
