## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The current hook system consists of 6 shell scripts in scripts/hooks/ (~1,867 lines total) that need streamlining. Per Epic-1, this over-engineered infrastructure must be simplified while preserving essential security and quality enforcement. The goal is to migrate from custom shell scripts to Claude Code native hooks configuration via .claude/settings.json.

### Essential Hook Categories ✅ **VERIFIED FROM CURRENT SYSTEM**

**Critical Security Hooks** (From bash_security.sh):
- Bash command security validation (prevent dangerous operations)
- Code security scanning (Semgrep integration for vulnerability detection)  
- Access control validation (ensure appropriate permissions)
- Credential security enforcement (prevent secrets in code)

**Critical Quality Hooks** (From code_quality_enforcer.sh):
- Code formatting enforcement (ruff, black, mypy integration)
- Test coverage validation (≥80% coverage requirement enforcement)
- Linting and type checking enforcement (maintain code standards)
- Code quality gates (prevent quality regressions)

### Hook System Simplification Strategy ✅ **CLAUDE CODE NATIVE MIGRATION**

**Remove Custom Shell Scripts** (scripts/hooks/ - 1,867 lines):
- environment_bridge.sh, subagent_dispatcher.sh, notification.sh, lightweight_validator.sh
- Complex hook orchestration and dependency management
- Over-engineered logging and monitoring hooks
- Redundant validation with overlapping functionality

**Preserve Essential Functionality via Native Hooks**:
- Migrate bash_security.sh functionality to native PreToolUse hooks
- Migrate code_quality_enforcer.sh functionality to native PostToolUse hooks
- Security vulnerability detection and prevention
- Code quality standards enforcement and coverage validation

**Native Configuration Migration** (Per Claude Code Documentation):
- Migrate to .claude/settings.json "hooks" section with official hook events:
  - **PreToolUse**: Security validation before tool execution (bash_security.sh → native)
  - **PostToolUse**: Quality enforcement after successful tool completion (code_quality_enforcer.sh → native)
  - **UserPromptSubmit**: Optional prompt validation if needed
- Remove complex hook customization and use native Claude Code hook patterns

### Integration with Native Patterns
- Hooks should complement, not conflict with, Claude Code native agent coordination
- Hook configuration should align with native .claude/settings.json approach
- Hook execution should be transparent to Claude Code platform features
- Hook system should be forward-compatible with Claude Code platform evolution

## Testing

### Testing Standards ✅ **NATIVE HOOKS VALIDATION**
- **Security Hook Testing**: Validate native PreToolUse hooks provide equivalent bash_security.sh functionality
- **Quality Hook Testing**: Verify native PostToolUse hooks provide equivalent code_quality_enforcer.sh functionality  
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure native hooks don't impact framework responsiveness (≤1s agent selection time per Epic-1)
- **Native Integration Testing**: Verify hooks work correctly with Claude Code platform features
- **Configuration Testing**: Validate .claude/settings.json hooks configuration works correctly
- **Regression Testing**: Confirm no loss of essential security or quality enforcement after migration

### Testing Framework & Approach ✅ **VERIFIED NATIVE PATTERNS**
- **Native Hook Events Testing**: Validate PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit hooks function correctly
- **Security Validation Testing**: Test native hooks catch dangerous bash commands and security vulnerabilities
- **Quality Enforcement Testing**: Test native hooks enforce ruff, black, mypy, and coverage requirements
- **Hook Configuration Testing**: Validate .claude/settings.json hooks section configuration works as documented
- **Performance Baseline Testing**: Measure hook execution time impact vs. current shell script performance
- **Platform Compatibility Testing**: Ensure native hooks work across Claude Code platform updates
- **Agent Coordination Testing**: Verify hooks don't interfere with .claude/agents/ system functionality
- **Rollback Testing**: Validate ability to rollback to shell script hooks if native migration issues discovered
