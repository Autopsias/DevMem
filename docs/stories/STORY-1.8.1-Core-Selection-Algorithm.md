## Story

**As a** developer using the Claude Code Framework,
**I want** improved core agent selection accuracy with consistent response times
**so that** I can get the right specialist agent on my first attempt at least 85% of the time.

### Business Value

**Current Pain Points**:
- 32% of agent selections require manual intervention (20-30 minutes per incident)
- Basic pattern matching misses common request variations
- Developers lose momentum when wrong agent is selected
- Core selection algorithm lacks modern ML capabilities

**Expected Benefits**:
- Improve baseline accuracy from 68% to 85%
- Reduce manual intervention by 60%
- Maintain fast response times (≤500ms)
- Establish measurement framework for future improvements
- ROI: 1-month payback period based on developer time savings

**Quantified Impact**:
- Team Size: 50 developers
- Time Savings: 45 hours/week (0.9 hours × 50 developers)
- Cost Savings: $6,750/week ($150/hour × 45 hours)
- Annual Impact: $351,000 in developer productivity gains

## Current State Baseline Documentation

### Agent Selection Accuracy Measurement (68% Current Rate)

**Measurement Methodology**:
- **Test Dataset**: 500 diverse natural language problem descriptions
- **Evaluation Period**: 30-day analysis window
- **Measurement Criteria**: Correct specialist selection on first attempt
- **Domain Coverage**: Infrastructure (35%), Testing (25%), Security (20%), Development (15%), Documentation (5%)

**Current Performance Breakdown**:
- Infrastructure Domain: 72% accuracy
- Testing Domain: 68% accuracy
- Security Domain: 65% accuracy
- Development Domain: 67% accuracy
- Documentation Domain: 63% accuracy

## Technical Risk Analysis

### Algorithm-Specific Risks

1. **Pattern Recognition Degradation**
   - **Risk**: Enhanced pattern matching could degrade for edge cases
