# ðŸ“‹ **Story 1.2: Basic Resource Awareness**

**Story ID**: S1.2  
**Epic**: E1 - Claude Code Optimization Foundation  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Estimated Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Done  

## **User Story**
**As a** system operator  
**I want** simple resource tracking  
**So that** coordination doesn't overload the system

## **Business Value**
Prevents system overload through intelligent resource awareness while providing strategic batching recommendations for large coordination requests.

## **Tasks**
- [x] Enhance agent descriptions with resource awareness intelligence
- [x] Implement natural resource validation through agent coordination patterns
- [x] Add intelligent batching recommendations in agent memory patterns
- [x] Establish Claude Code native resource management integration
- [x] Create resource awareness patterns in agent memory hierarchy

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Resource awareness without over-engineering
- âœ… Intelligent batching suggestions for large coordinations
- âœ… Basic performance tracking for learning

## **Technical Requirements**
- Agent descriptions enhanced with resource awareness patterns
- Natural Claude Code resource limit integration (10-agent parallel limit)
- Memory-driven batching strategy patterns for large coordinations
- Built-in token management through Claude Code native capabilities
- Resource intelligence embedded in agent coordination memory

## **Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: None - foundation story
- **Blocks**: Story 2.1 needs resource validation before parallel execution

## **Resource Limits & Thresholds**
- Claude Code's 10-agent parallel limit
- Token usage estimation and budgeting
- System resource awareness
- Batching recommendations for >6 agents

## **Definition of Done**
- [x] Agent descriptions enhanced with resource awareness intelligence
- [x] Claude Code native resource integration operational
- [x] Intelligent batching patterns established in agent memory
- [x] Resource awareness patterns documented and tested
- [x] Natural resource validation through agent coordination
- [x] Framework integration verified and documented

## **Testing Notes**
- Test resource validation with various agent counts
- Verify batching strategy suggestions
- Validate token estimation accuracy
- Test performance logging functionality

## **Notes**
- Keep implementation simple and effective
- Focus on preventing system overload
- Foundation for performance learning
