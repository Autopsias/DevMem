# ðŸ“‹ **Story 1.2: Basic Resource Awareness**

**Story ID**: S1.2  
**Epic**: E1 - Claude Code Optimization Foundation  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Estimated Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: Ready for Development  

## **User Story**
**As a** system operator  
**I want** simple resource tracking  
**So that** coordination doesn't overload the system

## **Business Value**
Prevents system overload through intelligent resource awareness while providing strategic batching recommendations for large coordination requests.

## **Tasks**
- [ ] Create `/scripts/claude_code_resource_tracker.py`
- [ ] Implement `can_start_coordination()` with agent count validation
- [ ] Add `suggest_batching_strategy()` for large coordinations
- [ ] Implement basic token estimation and warning system
- [ ] Add `log_coordination_performance()` for tracking

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- âœ… Resource awareness without over-engineering
- âœ… Intelligent batching suggestions for large coordinations
- âœ… Basic performance tracking for learning

## **Technical Requirements**
- Python script with resource tracking capabilities
- Agent count validation logic
- Batching strategy recommendations
- Token estimation system with warnings
- Performance logging for coordination tracking

## **Dependencies**
- **Prerequisites**: None - foundation story
- **Blocks**: Story 2.1 needs resource validation before parallel execution

## **Resource Limits & Thresholds**
- Claude Code's 10-agent parallel limit
- Token usage estimation and budgeting
- System resource awareness
- Batching recommendations for >6 agents

## **Definition of Done**
- [ ] Script created at specified path
- [ ] All methods implemented and tested
- [ ] Resource validation preventing overload
- [ ] Batching suggestions working for large coordinations
- [ ] Performance tracking operational
- [ ] Code reviewed and documented

## **Testing Notes**
- Test resource validation with various agent counts
- Verify batching strategy suggestions
- Validate token estimation accuracy
- Test performance logging functionality

## **Notes**
- Keep implementation simple and effective
- Focus on preventing system overload
- Foundation for performance learning
