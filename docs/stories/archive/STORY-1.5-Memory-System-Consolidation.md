## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The current memory system uses 7-file structure (~1,230 lines total) with 19 recursive imports that creates maintenance overhead while providing agent coordination intelligence. Per Epic-1, the goal is to consolidate to 2-file system while preserving all essential coordination patterns and learning.

### Current Memory Hierarchy ✅ **VERIFIED STRUCTURE**
**Successfully Consolidated 2-File System**:

1. `.claude/memory/coordination-hub.md`
   - Core agent coordination patterns
   - Sequential intelligence flows
   - Performance baselines
   - Meta-orchestration rules
   - Agent framework architecture

2. `.claude/memory/domain-intelligence.md`
   - Domain-specific expertise
   - Testing patterns
   - Infrastructure patterns  
   - Security patterns
   - Project-specific intelligence

All memory patterns successfully consolidated into streamlined 2-file architecture with maximum 2-level depth for optimal performance.

**Consolidation Strategy**:
- **7 files → 2 files**: Reduce from ~1,230 lines across 7 files to 2 comprehensive files
- **19 recursive imports → simplified references**: Eliminate cross-file @.claude/memory dependencies
- Preserve all essential intelligence while eliminating maintenance complexity
- Maintain Anthropic recursive memory standards (@path syntax where needed)

### Critical Memory Intelligence to Preserve
**Agent Coordination Intelligence**:
- Memory-driven agent selection patterns and success rates
- Sequential coordination patterns and context accumulation
- Parallel execution triggers and orchestration patterns
- Meta-orchestration triggers and escalation thresholds

**Domain-Specific Intelligence**:
- Testing domain coordination patterns and specialist combinations
- Infrastructure domain orchestration patterns and performance metrics
- Security domain escalation patterns and comprehensive analysis triggers
- Quality domain enforcement patterns and compliance validation

**Learning Integration**:
- Success pattern recognition and improvement over time
- Performance optimization learning and selection enhancement
- Context preservation patterns and intelligence accumulation

### Memory Performance Requirements
- Memory lookup time must not impact ≤1s agent selection requirement
- Agent selection accuracy must maintain >95% appropriate selection rate  
- Sequential coordination must preserve >91% context accumulation success
- Memory-driven learning must continue to improve patterns over time

## Testing

### Testing Standards ✅ **MEMORY CONSOLIDATION VALIDATION**
- **Memory Performance Testing**: Validate memory lookup speed meets ≤1s agent selection requirement (Per Epic-1)
- **Coordination Testing**: Verify agent selection accuracy preserved after consolidation from 7-file to 2-file system
- **Intelligence Testing**: Confirm learning patterns and success intelligence preserved during consolidation
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure consolidated memory system works with Claude Code native features and .claude/agents/ system
- **Migration Testing**: Validate successful migration from 7-file system to 2-file system without intelligence loss
- **Import Testing**: Verify 19 recursive imports properly consolidated and functionality preserved

### Testing Framework & Approach ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE MEMORY VALIDATION**
- **File Consolidation Testing**: Validate all 7 files properly merge into 2 files without content loss
- **Agent Selection Testing**: Test agent selection accuracy before/during/after memory consolidation
- **Coordination Pattern Testing**: Verify agent coordination patterns work correctly with consolidated memory
- **Recursive Import Testing**: Validate elimination of 19 @.claude/memory references doesn't break functionality
- **Memory Lookup Performance Testing**: Measure memory access time with 2-file system vs current 7-file system
- **Learning Preservation Testing**: Confirm agent learning and success patterns preserved in consolidated system
- **CLAUDE.md Integration Testing**: Verify consolidated memory imports work correctly from CLAUDE.md
- **Rollback Testing**: Validate ability to rollback to 7-file system if consolidation issues discovered
