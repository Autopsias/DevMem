2. Full backup of existing infrastructure code created and validated
3. Baseline performance metrics captured for comparison

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story establishes the foundation for Epic 1's infrastructure simplification. Per EPIC-1-Infrastructure-Foundation-Excellence.md, the DevMem agent framework currently contains over 11,000 lines of Claude Code sub-agent infrastructure that needs systematic assessment and backup before simplification.

### Current Infrastructure Components (Verified)
- **.claude/agents/ directory**: 39 Claude Code sub-agent definition files (~11,000 lines total)
  - 22 primary agent files in main directory
  - 17 secondary agent files in /secondary/ subdirectory
- **Agent coordination system**: Complex UltraThink analysis and parallel spawning logic
- **Memory hierarchy system**: .claude/memory/ with agent coordination patterns
- **Tool configuration**: Sophisticated tool permission and access control per agent
- **Sub-agent orchestration**: Following Anthropic's official Claude Code sub-agent guidelines

### Source Tree Context
```
.claude/
├── agents/                    # Primary and secondary agent definitions
│   ├── *.md                  # 22 primary agent files
│   └── secondary/            # 17 secondary agent files
├── memory/                   # Agent coordination memory patterns
└── settings.json            # Claude Code native configuration (target)

```

### Critical Success Factors (Per Epic-1)
- Zero agent functionality loss during infrastructure transition  
- Agent selection performance maintained or improved (≤1s target per Epic-1)
- Complete Anthropic Claude Code sub-agent standards compliance achieved
- Safe rollback capability at all stages of infrastructure changes

### Risk Mitigation Approach
- Incremental assessment and backup approach
- Comprehensive testing of backup procedures before any removal
- Performance baseline establishment for objective comparison
- Detailed dependency mapping to avoid cascade failures

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Agent Infrastructure Testing**: Validate Claude Code sub-agent system integrity and functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Validate backup/restore procedures work correctly with .claude/agents/ directory
- **Performance Testing**: Agent selection time baseline metrics captured (<1s target from Epic-1)
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure agent coordination and selection functionality preserved throughout process

### Testing Framework & Approach
- **Agent Selection Testing**: Measure agent selection response times using natural language triggers
- **Agent Coordination Testing**: Validate multi-agent parallel execution patterns still function
- **Backup Validation**: Test git branch backup and archive integrity for agent configuration files
- **Configuration Testing**: Verify agent YAML frontmatter and tool configurations remain valid
- **Memory System Testing**: Validate .claude/memory/ hierarchy integration with agents after changes
