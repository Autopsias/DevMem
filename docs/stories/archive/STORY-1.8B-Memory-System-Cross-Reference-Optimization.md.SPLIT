## Technical Risk Analysis

### Algorithm-Specific Risks

#### 1. Cross-Reference Resolution Algorithm Failure
**Risk Level**: High

  - Circular reference detection may fail, causing infinite loops
  - Memory access could degrade to 100% failure rate during transition
- **Probability**: Medium (25%)
- **Business Impact**: Critical ($75,000/week in complete system failure)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Reference Graph Analysis**: Pre-analyze all reference chains before changes
- **Staged Resolution Testing**: Test resolution changes on 5% of references first

- Memory access errors spike above 5%

**Recovery Procedures**:
1. **Immediate Fallback** (0-2 minutes): Switch to backup resolution algorithm
2. **Reference Cache Clear** (2-5 minutes): Invalidate all cached references
3. **Incremental Recovery** (5-30 minutes): Re-enable optimizations gradually
4. **Manual Resolution** (30+ minutes): Manually fix broken reference chains

#### 2. Cache Coherency Algorithm Instability  
**Risk Level**: Medium-High
