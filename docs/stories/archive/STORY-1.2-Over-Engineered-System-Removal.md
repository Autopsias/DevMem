## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context  
This is the core story of Epic 1, removing over-engineered **Python infrastructure** (src/ directory) that creates maintenance overhead and deviates from Anthropic Claude Code best practices. The goal is aggressive Python infrastructure simplification while **completely preserving** the Claude Code sub-agent system (.claude/agents/) and all essential functionality.

### **CRITICAL SCOPE DISTINCTION**
- **REMOVE**: Python infrastructure in src/ directory (~7,058 lines)
  - src/configuration/ (3,709 lines)
  - src/performance/ (3,349 lines)  
  - scripts/validation (~1,867 lines)
- **PRESERVE COMPLETELY**: Claude Code sub-agent system
  - .claude/agents/ directory (39 agent files, ~11,000 lines)
  - .claude/memory/ hierarchy system
  - All agent selection and coordination functionality

### Removal Strategy: Incremental Phases
**Phase 1: Python Configuration System (src/configuration/ - 3,709 lines)**
- Complex Python configuration management → Claude Code native .claude/settings.json
- Multi-file configuration hierarchy → Single native configuration approach
- Custom configuration loading → Claude Code platform configuration features

**Phase 2: Python Performance Monitoring (src/performance/ - 3,349 lines)**  
- Complex Python performance monitoring infrastructure → Lightweight native monitoring
- Custom performance metrics collection → Claude Code platform performance insights  
- Performance dashboard systems → Simple monitoring via native platform features

**Phase 3: Over-engineered Validation Scripts (scripts/ - ~1,867 lines)**
- Complex validation script ecosystem → Essential quality hooks only
- Multi-layer validation systems → Streamlined security and quality enforcement
- Custom validation frameworks → Claude Code native validation patterns

### Preservation Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Claude Code Sub-Agent System**: .claude/agents/ directory completely untouched and functional
- **Agent Selection Performance**: Must maintain ≤1s agent selection time (Per Epic-1)
- **Agent Coordination**: All 39 agent files and coordination patterns preserved
- **Memory System Functionality**: .claude/memory/ hierarchy features preserved  
- **Security Enforcement**: Essential security checks preserved in streamlined hooks
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality enforcement maintained with minimal Python infrastructure

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Incremental Approach**: Remove systems in phases with rollback points
- **Functionality First**: Verify preservation before proceeding to next phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance validation during removal
- **Rollback Readiness**: Tested rollback procedures at each phase

### Critical Success Metrics (Per Epic-1)
- 90% **Python** infrastructure code reduction achieved (~7,058 → <500 lines)
- Zero functionality regression (especially Claude Code sub-agent system)
- Agent selection performance maintained or improved (≤1s)
- Complete Anthropic Claude Code standards compliance
- .claude/agents/ system completely preserved and functional

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Python Infrastructure Removal Testing**: Validate removal phases don't affect Claude Code sub-agent functionality  
- **Regression Testing**: Full test suite after each removal phase with focus on agent system preservation

- **Integration Testing**: Verify Claude Code platform integration works correctly after Python infrastructure removal
- **Security Testing**: Validate security enforcement preserved in streamlined hooks
- **Quality Testing**: Verify code quality gates maintained with minimal infrastructure

### Testing Framework & Approach
- **Agent System Preservation Testing**: After each removal phase, validate all 39 Claude Code agents still function
- **Agent Selection Testing**: Measure and validate ≤1s agent selection performance maintained throughout removal
- **Agent Coordination Testing**: Validate multi-agent parallel execution patterns unaffected by Python infrastructure removal
- **Memory Integration Testing**: Verify .claude/memory/ hierarchy system works correctly after removals
- **Configuration Migration Testing**: Validate essential configurations migrated correctly to .claude/settings.json
- **Performance Baseline Testing**: Continuous monitoring that Python infrastructure removal maintains or improves performance
- **Rollback Testing**: Validate rollback procedures work at each phase if issues discovered
