## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the replacement configuration system after removing the complex Python src/configuration/ directory (3,709 lines). The goal is to achieve equivalent functionality using Claude Code native patterns with significantly reduced complexity while preserving the .claude/agents/ sub-agent system functionality.

### Claude Code Native Configuration Approach ✅ **VERIFIED**
Per official Anthropic documentation, Claude Code supports native configuration via hierarchical settings.json files:

**Native Configuration Structure**:
- **User settings**: `~/.claude/settings.json` (applies to all projects)
- **Project settings**: `.claude/settings.json` (shared/checked into source control)  
- **Local settings**: `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal, not checked in)
- **Enterprise policies**: System-level managed settings (highest priority)

**✅ VERIFIED Native Features**:
- **Hierarchical configuration**: Multiple configuration layers with proper precedence
- **Environment variables**: Native `env` configuration support
- **Tool permissions**: Native `permissions` allow/deny configuration
- **Hooks integration**: Native `hooks` configuration for pre/post tool execution
- **Model configuration**: Native `model` override support
- **Configuration commands**: `claude config` command-line management tools

**Native Pattern Integration** (Per Official Documentation):
- **Environment variables**: Migrate Python configuration to native `env` settings
- **Tool permissions**: Replace custom validation with native `permissions` allow/deny rules
- **Hooks configuration**: Streamline to essential security/quality hooks using native `hooks` settings  
- **Model configuration**: Use native `model` override for performance optimization
- **Integration with existing**: Coordinate with .claude/agents/ and .claude/memory/ systems

### Configuration Migration Strategy ✅ **VERIFIED APPROACH**
**From Complex Python Hierarchy → To Native Hierarchical Settings**:
- **src/configuration/environment/** → `.claude/settings.json` `"env"` section
- **src/configuration/permissions/** → `.claude/settings.json` `"permissions"` section  
- **src/configuration/hooks/** → `.claude/settings.json` `"hooks"` section
- **src/configuration/performance/** → `.claude/settings.json` `"model"` and performance-related env vars
- **Coordination with existing systems**: Ensure settings work with .claude/agents/ and .claude/memory/

**Simplification Principles** (Using Native Features):
- **Hierarchical precedence**: Use Claude Code's native settings hierarchy instead of custom logic
- **Native validation**: Leverage Claude Code's native JSON validation instead of custom validators
- **Platform defaults**: Use Claude Code platform defaults where possible
- **Essential configuration only**: Focus on configuration that adds value beyond defaults
- **Command-line management**: Use `claude config` commands for settings management

### Critical Configuration Areas ✅ **MAPPED TO NATIVE FEATURES**

**Environment & Performance** (Using native `"env"` section):
- Essential environment variables for agent performance
- Configuration that supports ≤1s agent selection time requirement
- Performance-related environment variables

**Tool Permissions & Security** (Using native `"permissions"` section):
- Replace custom validation logic with native allow/deny rules
- Security-focused tool permission configuration
- Quality gate enforcement through permission controls

**Hooks Integration** (Using native `"hooks"` section):
- Essential pre/post tool execution hooks for security and quality
- Streamlined hook configuration (vs. current complex system)
- Integration with quality enforcement workflows

**Model & Platform** (Using native `"model"` and related sections):
- Model configuration for optimal performance
- Platform integration settings
- Configuration that works seamlessly with .claude/agents/ and .claude/memory/ systems

## Testing
