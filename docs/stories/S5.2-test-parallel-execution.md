# Story 5.2: Test True Parallel Execution

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Claude Code Framework user,
**I want** validated parallel execution capabilities for multiple agent scenarios,
**so that** I can confidently coordinate 3, 5, and 10 agents simultaneously with independent context windows.

## Acceptance Criteria
5. Parallel execution validated for 3, 5, and 10 agent scenarios
6. Independent context windows confirmed for each agent

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create parallel execution test framework (AC: 5,6)
  - [x] Design test scenarios for 3-agent parallel execution
  - [x] Design test scenarios for 5-agent parallel execution
  - [x] Design test scenarios for 10-agent parallel execution
- [x] Implement 3-agent parallel execution tests (AC: 5,6)
  - [x] Test independent context windows for 3 agents
  - [x] Validate coordination without context bleeding
  - [x] Measure execution performance and timing
- [x] Implement 5-agent parallel execution tests (AC: 5,6)
  - [x] Test independent context windows for 5 agents
  - [x] Validate complex multi-domain coordination
  - [x] Measure scalability performance
- [x] Implement 10-agent parallel execution tests (AC: 5,6)
  - [x] Test independent context windows for 10 agents
  - [x] Validate large-scale coordination capabilities
  - [x] Establish performance benchmarks
- [x] Document parallel execution capabilities and limitations (AC: 5,6)

## Dev Notes
- **Relevant Source Tree**: `tests/test_parallel_execution.py`, `scripts/parallel_test_runner.py`
- **Key Context**: Validates theoretical parallel coordination with practical testing
- **Performance Target**: Establish benchmarks for coordination effectiveness optimization in E6
- **Context Independence**: Critical that each agent maintains separate conversation space
- **Scaling Validation**: Must prove system can handle sophisticated multi-domain coordination

### Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/test_parallel_execution.py`
- **Test frameworks**: pytest with async testing capabilities
- **Specific requirements**: Validate context independence and coordination integrity
- **Performance testing**: Measure response times and resource usage for parallel scenarios
