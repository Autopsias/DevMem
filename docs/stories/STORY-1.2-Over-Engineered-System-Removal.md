# Story 1.2: Over-Engineered System Removal

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** framework maintainer,
**I want** systematic removal of over-engineered infrastructure components (configuration/, performance/, validation scripts),
**so that** I can achieve 90% maintenance reduction while preserving essential functionality and Anthropic compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove configuration/ directory (3,709 lines) while preserving functionality
2. Remove performance/ directory (3,349 lines) while maintaining monitoring capability  
3. Remove validation scripts while preserving quality assurance
4. Verify zero functionality regression after removals
5. Achieve target 90% infrastructure code reduction (from 7,000+ lines to <500 lines)
6. Maintain Claude Code native pattern compliance throughout removal process
7. Preserve all essential security and quality enforcement mechanisms
8. Complete incremental removal with rollback points at each major step

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This is the core story of Epic 1, removing over-engineered infrastructure that creates maintenance overhead and deviates from Anthropic Claude Code best practices. The goal is aggressive simplification while maintaining all essential functionality.

### Removal Strategy: Incremental Phases
**Phase 1: Configuration System (3,709 lines)**
- Complex configuration management → Claude Code native .claude/settings.json
- Multi-file configuration hierarchy → Single native configuration approach
- Custom configuration loading → Claude Code platform configuration features

**Phase 2: Performance Monitoring (3,349 lines)**  
- Complex performance monitoring infrastructure → Lightweight native monitoring
- Custom performance metrics collection → Claude Code platform performance insights
- Performance dashboard systems → Simple monitoring via native platform features

**Phase 3: Validation Scripts (Variable lines)**
- Complex validation script ecosystem → Essential quality hooks only
- Multi-layer validation systems → Streamlined security and quality enforcement
- Custom validation frameworks → Claude Code native validation patterns

### Preservation Requirements
- **Agent Selection Performance**: Must maintain ≤1s agent selection time
- **Memory System Functionality**: All memory hierarchy features preserved in simplified form
- **Security Enforcement**: All essential security checks preserved in streamlined hooks
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality enforcement maintained with minimal infrastructure

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Incremental Approach**: Remove systems in phases with rollback points
- **Functionality First**: Verify preservation before proceeding to next phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance validation during removal
- **Rollback Readiness**: Tested rollback procedures at each phase

### Critical Success Metrics
- 90% infrastructure code reduction achieved (7,000+ → <500 lines)
- Zero functionality regression
- Performance maintained or improved
- Complete Anthropic standards compliance

### Testing Standards
- **Regression Testing**: Full test suite after each removal phase
- **Performance Testing**: Continuous performance monitoring during removal
- **Integration Testing**: Verify Claude Code platform integration works correctly
- **Security Testing**: Validate security enforcement preserved
- **Quality Testing**: Verify code quality gates maintained
