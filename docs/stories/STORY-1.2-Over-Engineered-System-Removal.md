## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** framework maintainer,
**I want** systematic removal of over-engineered Python infrastructure components (src/configuration/, src/performance/, scripts/validation) while preserving Claude Code sub-agent system,
**so that** I can achieve 90% maintenance reduction while preserving essential agent functionality and Anthropic compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Remove src/configuration/ directory (3,709 lines) while preserving functionality via Claude Code native patterns
2. Remove src/performance/ directory (3,349 lines) while maintaining monitoring capability via native features
3. Remove over-engineered validation scripts while preserving essential quality assurance
4. Verify zero functionality regression after removals (especially Claude Code sub-agent system functionality)
5. Achieve target 90% Python infrastructure code reduction (from ~7,058 lines to <500 lines)
6. Maintain Claude Code native pattern compliance throughout removal process
7. Preserve all essential security and quality enforcement mechanisms via streamlined hooks
8. Complete incremental removal with rollback points at each major step
9. Ensure .claude/agents/ sub-agent system functionality is completely preserved and unaffected

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context  
This is the core story of Epic 1, removing over-engineered **Python infrastructure** (src/ directory) that creates maintenance overhead and deviates from Anthropic Claude Code best practices. The goal is aggressive Python infrastructure simplification while **completely preserving** the Claude Code sub-agent system (.claude/agents/) and all essential functionality.

### **CRITICAL SCOPE DISTINCTION**
- **REMOVE**: Python infrastructure in src/ directory (~7,058 lines)
  - src/configuration/ (3,709 lines)
  - src/performance/ (3,349 lines)  
  - scripts/validation (~1,867 lines)
- **PRESERVE COMPLETELY**: Claude Code sub-agent system
  - .claude/agents/ directory (39 agent files, ~11,000 lines)
  - .claude/memory/ hierarchy system
  - All agent selection and coordination functionality

### Removal Strategy: Incremental Phases
**Phase 1: Python Configuration System (src/configuration/ - 3,709 lines)**
- Complex Python configuration management → Claude Code native .claude/settings.json
- Multi-file configuration hierarchy → Single native configuration approach
- Custom configuration loading → Claude Code platform configuration features

**Phase 2: Python Performance Monitoring (src/performance/ - 3,349 lines)**  
- Complex Python performance monitoring infrastructure → Lightweight native monitoring
- Custom performance metrics collection → Claude Code platform performance insights  
- Performance dashboard systems → Simple monitoring via native platform features

**Phase 3: Over-engineered Validation Scripts (scripts/ - ~1,867 lines)**
- Complex validation script ecosystem → Essential quality hooks only
- Multi-layer validation systems → Streamlined security and quality enforcement
- Custom validation frameworks → Claude Code native validation patterns

### Preservation Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Claude Code Sub-Agent System**: .claude/agents/ directory completely untouched and functional
- **Agent Selection Performance**: Must maintain ≤1s agent selection time (Per Epic-1)
- **Agent Coordination**: All 39 agent files and coordination patterns preserved
- **Memory System Functionality**: .claude/memory/ hierarchy features preserved  
- **Security Enforcement**: Essential security checks preserved in streamlined hooks
- **Quality Gates**: Code quality enforcement maintained with minimal Python infrastructure

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
- **Incremental Approach**: Remove systems in phases with rollback points
- **Functionality First**: Verify preservation before proceeding to next phase
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance validation during removal
- **Rollback Readiness**: Tested rollback procedures at each phase

### Critical Success Metrics (Per Epic-1)
- 90% **Python** infrastructure code reduction achieved (~7,058 → <500 lines)
- Zero functionality regression (especially Claude Code sub-agent system)
- Agent selection performance maintained or improved (≤1s)
- Complete Anthropic Claude Code standards compliance
- .claude/agents/ system completely preserved and functional

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- **Python Infrastructure Removal Testing**: Validate removal phases don't affect Claude Code sub-agent functionality  
- **Regression Testing**: Full test suite after each removal phase with focus on agent system preservation
- **Performance Testing**: Agent selection time monitoring during removal (≤1s target maintenance)
- **Integration Testing**: Verify Claude Code platform integration works correctly after Python infrastructure removal
- **Security Testing**: Validate security enforcement preserved in streamlined hooks
- **Quality Testing**: Verify code quality gates maintained with minimal infrastructure

### Testing Framework & Approach
- **Agent System Preservation Testing**: After each removal phase, validate all 39 Claude Code agents still function
- **Agent Selection Testing**: Measure and validate ≤1s agent selection performance maintained throughout removal
- **Agent Coordination Testing**: Validate multi-agent parallel execution patterns unaffected by Python infrastructure removal
- **Memory Integration Testing**: Verify .claude/memory/ hierarchy system works correctly after removals
- **Configuration Migration Testing**: Validate essential configurations migrated correctly to .claude/settings.json
- **Performance Baseline Testing**: Continuous monitoring that Python infrastructure removal maintains or improves performance
- **Rollback Testing**: Validate rollback procedures work at each phase if issues discovered
