## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
After completing major infrastructure simplification (removing 7,000+ lines to <500 lines), this story ensures the simplified infrastructure works correctly and is properly documented for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting.

### Infrastructure Validation Scope
**Complete System Integration Testing**:
- Validate all infrastructure components work together correctly after simplification
- Test infrastructure under various load and usage scenarios
- Validate no functionality regression from infrastructure changes
- Ensure performance targets achieved (≤1s agent selection, maintained reliability)

**Claude Code Native Pattern Validation**:
- Verify .claude/settings.json works correctly with Claude Code platform
- Test memory system integration with Claude Code native features
- Validate hook system doesn't interfere with Claude Code platform updates
- Ensure forward compatibility with Claude Code platform evolution

### Documentation Strategy: Essential Only
**Focus Areas for Documentation**:
- Practical maintenance procedures for simplified infrastructure
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues in simplified system
- Configuration management using .claude/settings.json
- Memory system maintenance for 2-file consolidated approach
- Hook system maintenance for essential hooks only

**Documentation to Remove/Simplify**:
- Complex infrastructure documentation no longer relevant
- Over-engineered system documentation and procedures
- Redundant or outdated architectural documentation
- Complex configuration management documentation

### Validation Priorities
**Critical Validation Areas**:
1. **Agent Coordination**: Verify agent selection and coordination work flawlessly
2. **Memory Intelligence**: Confirm memory-driven coordination intelligence preserved
3. **Security & Quality**: Validate essential security and quality enforcement maintained
4. **Performance**: Ensure ≤1s agent selection time and maintained reliability
5. **Anthropic Compliance**: Verify full Claude Code standards compliance

**Documentation Priorities**:
1. **Practical Maintenance**: Focus on day-to-day maintenance procedures
2. **Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive problem-solving guidance
3. **Emergency Procedures**: Rollback and recovery procedures for critical issues
4. **Best Practices**: Guidance for maintaining simplified infrastructure optimally

### Testing Standards
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing of simplified infrastructure integration
- **Performance Testing**: Validate infrastructure meets performance requirements
- **Compliance Testing**: Verify Anthropic standards compliance maintained
- **Documentation Testing**: Verify documentation accuracy and usability
- **Rollback Testing**: Validate rollback procedures work correctly
