## Technical Requirements

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component functionality after infrastructure changes
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-component coordination and communication
- **System Testing**: End-to-end framework functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking and optimization validation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Framework usability and effectiveness

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Agent Selection Time**: <1s average (target from Epic 2)
- **Coordination Effectiveness**: >95% appropriate agent selection
- **Memory System Performance**: Faster or equivalent lookup times
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimized or maintained resource usage
- **Configuration Loading**: Fast configuration processing

### Validation Criteria
- **Functionality**: 100% of previous functionality preserved
- **Performance**: No performance regression, ideally improvement
- **Quality**: All quality gates and enforcement preserved
- **Security**: All security enforcement maintained
- **Usability**: Framework remains easy to use and understand

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **All Previous Stories**: Stories 1.1-1.5 must be completed successfully
- **Framework State**: Simplified infrastructure must be fully implemented

### External Dependencies
- Testing environment availability
- Performance testing tools and infrastructure
- Documentation review and approval processes

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **Functionality Regression Risk**: Simplified infrastructure missing critical functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing, systematic validation, rollback capability

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Regression Risk**: Simplified infrastructure performs worse than complex system
  - *Mitigation*: Performance benchmarking, optimization, measurement against targets

### Low Risk
- **Documentation Gap Risk**: Documentation doesn't adequately reflect changes
  - *Mitigation*: Systematic documentation review, team validation, user feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Comprehensive Testing Framework
```python
def validate_infrastructure_simplification():
    # Functionality validation
    validate_all_agents_functional()
    validate_coordination_patterns()
    validate_natural_delegation()
    validate_hook_systems()
    validate_memory_system()
    
    # Performance validation
    benchmark_agent_selection_time()
    benchmark_coordination_performance()
    benchmark_memory_lookup_performance()
    benchmark_resource_utilization()
    
    # Integration validation
    validate_claude_code_integration()
    validate_configuration_system()
    validate_cross_domain_coordination()
    validate_error_handling()
    
    return comprehensive_validation_report()
```
