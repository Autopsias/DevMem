## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
After completing major infrastructure simplification per Stories 1.2-1.5 (Python infrastructure removal ~7,058 lines, hook script consolidation ~1,867 lines, memory system consolidation from 7 files to 2 files), this story ensures the simplified infrastructure works correctly and is properly documented for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting.

### Infrastructure Validation Scope
**Complete System Integration Testing** (After Stories 1.2-1.5):
- Validate Python infrastructure removal doesn't affect Claude Code sub-agent functionality
- Test native .claude/settings.json configuration integration (Story 1.3)
- Test streamlined hook system with essential security/quality enforcement (Story 1.4)
- Test consolidated 2-file memory system functionality (Story 1.5)
- Ensure performance targets achieved (≤1s agent selection per Epic-1, maintained reliability)

**Claude Code Native Pattern Validation**:
- Verify .claude/settings.json works correctly with Claude Code platform (per verified native capabilities)
- Test consolidated memory system integration with .claude/agents/ system
- Validate streamlined hooks don't interfere with Claude Code platform updates
- Ensure forward compatibility with Claude Code platform evolution

### Documentation Strategy: Essential Only
**Focus Areas for Documentation**:
- Practical maintenance procedures for simplified infrastructure
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues in simplified system
- Configuration management using .claude/settings.json
- Memory system maintenance for 2-file consolidated approach
- Hook system maintenance for essential hooks only

**Documentation to Remove/Simplify**:
- Complex infrastructure documentation no longer relevant
- Over-engineered system documentation and procedures
- Redundant or outdated architectural documentation
- Complex configuration management documentation

### Validation Priorities
**Critical Validation Areas**:
1. **Agent Coordination**: Verify agent selection and coordination work flawlessly
2. **Memory Intelligence**: Confirm memory-driven coordination intelligence preserved
3. **Security & Quality**: Validate essential security and quality enforcement maintained
4. **Performance**: Ensure ≤1s agent selection time and maintained reliability
5. **Anthropic Compliance**: Verify full Claude Code standards compliance

**Documentation Priorities**:
1. **Practical Maintenance**: Focus on day-to-day maintenance procedures
2. **Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive problem-solving guidance
3. **Emergency Procedures**: Rollback and recovery procedures for critical issues
4. **Best Practices**: Guidance for maintaining simplified infrastructure optimally

## Testing

### Testing Standards ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE VALIDATION**
- **End-to-End Integration Testing**: Validate all simplified infrastructure components work together correctly after Stories 1.2-1.5
- **Performance Testing**: Validate infrastructure meets ≤1s agent selection time requirement (Per Epic-1)
- **Compliance Testing**: Verify Anthropic Claude Code standards compliance maintained throughout simplification
- **Documentation Testing**: Verify documentation accuracy and usability for simplified infrastructure maintenance
- **Rollback Testing**: Validate rollback procedures work correctly for each simplification phase
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure no functionality loss from infrastructure simplification

### Testing Framework & Approach ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION STRATEGY**
- **Python Infrastructure Removal Testing**: Validate removal of src/configuration/ and src/performance/ doesn't affect essential functionality
- **Native Configuration Testing**: Test .claude/settings.json integration with Claude Code platform (Story 1.3 validation)
- **Streamlined Hooks Testing**: Validate essential security/quality hooks work correctly with native Claude Code hooks (Story 1.4 validation)
- **Memory System Testing**: Test consolidated 2-file memory system provides same intelligence as previous 7-file system (Story 1.5 validation)
- **Claude Code Sub-Agent Testing**: Verify .claude/agents/ system completely unaffected by infrastructure changes
- **Cross-Story Integration Testing**: Validate all infrastructure changes from Stories 1.2-1.5 work together seamlessly
- **Documentation Validation Testing**: Test all updated documentation against actual implemented infrastructure
- **Emergency Recovery Testing**: Validate rollback and recovery procedures work correctly if issues discovered
