## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
The current memory system uses complex 5-hop recursive memory hierarchy that creates maintenance overhead while providing agent coordination intelligence. The goal is to consolidate to 2-file system while preserving all essential coordination patterns and learning.

### Current Memory Hierarchy (5-Hop Complexity)
**Current Structure**:
- `.claude/memory/agent-coordination-patterns.md` (primary coordination patterns)
- `.claude/memory/domains/testing-patterns.md` (domain-specific testing intelligence)  
- `.claude/memory/domains/infrastructure-patterns.md` (domain-specific infrastructure intelligence)
- `.claude/memory/domains/security-patterns.md` (domain-specific security intelligence)
- Additional recursive imports and cross-references creating 5-hop depth

### Simplified Memory Architecture (2-File System)
**Proposed Structure**:
- **File 1**: `.claude/memory/coordination-intelligence.md` (consolidated agent coordination patterns, selection intelligence, success patterns)
- **File 2**: `.claude/memory/domain-expertise.md` (consolidated domain-specific patterns: testing, infrastructure, security, quality)

**Consolidation Strategy**:
- Merge agent coordination patterns into single comprehensive intelligence file
- Merge domain-specific expertise into single domain knowledge file
- Preserve all essential intelligence while eliminating complexity
- Maintain Anthropic recursive memory standards (@path syntax)

### Critical Memory Intelligence to Preserve
**Agent Coordination Intelligence**:
- Memory-driven agent selection patterns and success rates
- Sequential coordination patterns and context accumulation
- Parallel execution triggers and orchestration patterns
- Meta-orchestration triggers and escalation thresholds

**Domain-Specific Intelligence**:
- Testing domain coordination patterns and specialist combinations
- Infrastructure domain orchestration patterns and performance metrics
- Security domain escalation patterns and comprehensive analysis triggers
- Quality domain enforcement patterns and compliance validation

**Learning Integration**:
- Success pattern recognition and improvement over time
- Performance optimization learning and selection enhancement
- Context preservation patterns and intelligence accumulation

### Memory Performance Requirements
- Memory lookup time must not impact ≤1s agent selection requirement
- Agent selection accuracy must maintain >95% appropriate selection rate  
- Sequential coordination must preserve >91% context accumulation success
- Memory-driven learning must continue to improve patterns over time

### Testing Standards
- **Memory Performance Testing**: Validate memory lookup speed meets requirements
- **Coordination Testing**: Verify agent selection accuracy preserved after consolidation
- **Intelligence Testing**: Confirm learning patterns and success intelligence preserved
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure memory system works with Claude Code native features
- **Migration Testing**: Validate successful migration from 5-hop to 2-file system
