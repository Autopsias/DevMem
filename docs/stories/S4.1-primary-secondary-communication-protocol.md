## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architecture Context
This story implements the core communication architecture that enables the sophisticated agent coordination patterns described in the Claude Code Framework documentation. The implementation must align with Anthropic's official standards for agent coordination and hierarchical memory management.

### Key Framework Integration Points
- **Agent Memory Patterns**: Integration with `.claude/memory/agent-coordination-patterns.md` for coordination intelligence
- **Sequential Intelligence**: Support for context accumulation patterns through agent transitions  
- **Parallel Execution**: Foundation for parallel agent spawning with structured coordination
- **Meta-Orchestration**: Enable complex multi-domain coordination through primary-secondary hierarchies

### Technical Architecture Requirements
- **Spawning Protocol**: Enhanced agent configuration patterns in `.claude/agents/*.md` for structured Task() delegation
- **Response Protocol**: Hierarchical response format embedded in secondary agent `.md` configurations
- **Coordination Metadata**: Agent configuration intelligence for tracking relationships and context preservation
- **Integration Intelligence**: Coordination patterns embedded in agent `.md` files for cross-domain analysis

### Critical Design Considerations
- **Context Preservation**: Ensure critical information flows seamlessly through hierarchical communication
- **Integration Guidance**: Secondary agents must provide sufficient metadata for primary agents to create unified solutions
- **Scalability**: Design must support complex coordination patterns without excessive overhead
- **Debugging**: Communication flows must be traceable for framework development and troubleshooting

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location**: Agent coordination validation through actual Claude Code agent execution
- **Testing Framework**: Claude Code agent framework with Task() coordination testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end hierarchical agent coordination workflows using real agents
- **Agent Requirements**: Primary and secondary agent coordination validation in `.claude/agents/` directory
- **Coverage Requirement**: ≥82% agent coordination effectiveness validation across communication scenarios

### Performance Requirements
- **Agent Spawning**: <2s for primary → secondary agent coordination using enhanced Task() patterns
- **Response Integration**: <1s for secondary agent response processing by enhanced primary agents
- **Context Preservation**: >98% critical information retention through agent coordination intelligence
- **Coordination Efficiency**: <15% performance impact from agent configuration enhancements
