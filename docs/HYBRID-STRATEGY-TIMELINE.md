## **Success Metrics Alignment**

### **Brief 1 Objectives Achieved**
- ✅ **90% Infrastructure Reduction**: 7,000+ → <500 lines (Weeks 1-2)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Natural Delegation**: Hybrid coordination operational (Weeks 5-6)
- ✅ **3-Week Core Completion**: Infrastructure + Foundation (Weeks 1-2) + Buffer (Weeks 3-6)

## **Deferred Elements (Post-Hybrid Enhancement)**

### **Future Phase (Weeks 7+)**: Secondary Agent Enhancement
- STORY-2.5: Secondary Agent Standardization (19 agents) - 21 points
- STORY-2.6: Cross-Agent Coordination Validation - 8 points
- Additional MCP service integrations
- Advanced coordination intelligence patterns

**Rationale**: Hybrid strategy delivers core objectives in 6 weeks. Secondary agents can be enhanced in subsequent phase without impacting primary framework functionality.

---

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Timeline Risk**: 6 weeks vs 3-week Brief 1 expectation
**Mitigation**: Deliver core Brief 1 objectives (infrastructure + natural delegation) by Week 6 with essential agent enhancement as value-add

### **Scope Risk**: Reduced agent enhancement vs Brief 2 comprehensive approach  
**Mitigation**: Focus on 20 most critical agents first, defer 19 secondary agents to post-hybrid phase

### **Quality Risk**: Compressed timeline might impact quality
**Mitigation**: Essential testing in each sprint, performance validation throughout, comprehensive testing in Week 5
