# Rollback and Recovery Procedures

## Rollback Triggers

### Performance Degradation
Initiate rollback if:
- Memory access time >25ms for 5 consecutive minutes
- Cache hit ratio <85% for 5 consecutive minutes
- Context preservation <90% for any coordination
- Agent selection time >1s for 3 consecutive attempts

### Functionality Loss
Rollback immediately if:
- Memory file corruption detected
- Critical agent coordination failures
- System health check fails
- Test failures in core functionality

### Integration Issues
Consider rollback if:
- Claude Code framework incompatibility
- Persistent coordination failures
- Security pattern violations
- Configuration synchronization issues

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (Memory System)
For issues with memory system updates:
```bash
# 1. Stop affected services
./scripts/system/stop_services.sh

# 2. Restore memory files
cp .claude/memory/backup/coordination-hub.md .claude/memory/coordination-hub.md
cp .claude/memory/backup/domain-intelligence.md .claude/memory/domain-intelligence.md

# 3. Verify restoration
./scripts/system/simple_health_check.sh

# 4. Restart services
./scripts/system/start_services.sh
```

### Full System Rollback
For major infrastructure issues:
```bash
# 1. Stop all services
./scripts/system/stop_all.sh

# 2. Restore from last known good state
./scripts/system/restore_system.sh --latest-good

# 3. Verify system health
./scripts/system/system_health.sh

# 4. Run validation tests
pytest

# 5. Restart services
./scripts/system/start_all.sh
```

### Configuration Rollback
For configuration issues:
```bash
# 1. Backup current config
cp .claude/settings.json .claude/settings.json.broken

# 2. Restore last good config
cp .claude/backup/settings.json.good .claude/settings.json

# 3. Verify configuration
./scripts/system/verify_config.sh

# 4. Test functionality
./scripts/system/simple_health_check.sh
```

## Emergency Recovery

### System Failure Recovery
1. Stop all services immediately
2. Assess failure scope and impact
3. Identify last known good state
4. Execute appropriate rollback procedure
5. Verify system health and functionality
6. Document incident and resolution

### Data Recovery
1. Identify corrupted or missing files
2. Stop affected services
3. Restore from latest backup
4. Verify file integrity
5. Test system functionality
6. Document recovery process

### Performance Recovery
1. Monitor system metrics
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Apply performance fixes
4. Validate improvements
5. Update performance baselines
6. Document optimizations

## Validation Requirements

### Pre-Rollback Validation
- Confirm rollback trigger conditions
- Verify backup availability
- Check system dependencies
- Document current state
- Create recovery plan

### Post-Rollback Validation
- Verify file integrity
- Run system health checks
- Test core functionality
- Validate performance metrics
- Document changes

## Backup Strategy

### System State Backup
```bash
# Daily automated backup
0 0 * * * ./scripts/system/backup_system.sh --daily

# Pre-update backup
./scripts/system/backup_system.sh --pre-update

# Manual backup
./scripts/system/backup_system.sh --manual "reason_for_backup"
```

### Backup Retention
- Daily backups: 7 days
- Weekly backups: 4 weeks
- Monthly backups: 6 months
- Pre-update backups: Until verified
- Manual backups: Per policy

## Recovery Testing

### Regular Testing
- Monthly recovery drills
- Quarterly full system recovery test
- Update recovery procedures as needed
- Document test results

### Test Scenarios
1. Memory system failure
2. Configuration corruption
3. Performance degradation
4. Integration failures
5. Security incidents

## Documentation Requirements

### Incident Documentation
- Date and time
- Issue description
- Rollback trigger
- Recovery steps taken
- Validation results
- Lessons learned

### Recovery Report
- Recovery process used
- Time to recover
- Success metrics
- Issues encountered
- Follow-up actions
- Recommendations

## Post-Recovery Actions

### Analysis
1. Investigate root cause
2. Review trigger conditions
3. Assess procedure effectiveness
4. Identify improvements
5. Update documentation

### Prevention
1. Update monitoring
2. Improve backup strategy
3. Enhance validation
4. Update procedures
5. Train team members
