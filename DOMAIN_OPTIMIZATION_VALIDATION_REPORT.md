## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

1. **Agent Selection Framework Integration Gap**
   - Enhanced patterns not fully integrated into agent selector
   - Disconnect between domain detection and agent selection
   - Fallback to default agents (digdeep) too frequently

2. **Pattern Recognition vs Agent Selection Mismatch**
   - Cross-domain coordinator detects domains correctly
   - Agent selector doesn't utilize domain analysis effectively
   - Confidence scoring not properly transferred

3. **Test Framework Inconsistencies**
   - Different testing methodologies showing different results
   - Benchmark tests vs comprehensive tests divergence
   - Need unified validation approach

### Technical Debt Areas

1. **Integration Architecture**
   - Enhanced coordinator operates independently
   - Agent selector needs better integration with domain analysis
   - Configuration management across systems

2. **Pattern Library Synchronization**
   - Multiple pattern systems not fully synchronized
   - Need centralized pattern management
   - Version control for pattern updates

   def enhanced_select_agent(query):
       domain_analysis = analyze_cross_domain_query(query)
       if domain_analysis.detected_boundaries:
           return domain_analysis.agent_suggestions[0]
       return fallback_selection(query)
   ```

2. **Pattern Library Consolidation**
   - Merge enhanced patterns into agent selector
   - Implement centralized pattern management
   - Ensure consistency across all systems

3. **Test Framework Unification**
   - Standardize testing approach

       'security': 1.4,
       'performance': 1.1,
       'documentation': 1.0
   }
   ```

2. **Confidence Score Optimization**
