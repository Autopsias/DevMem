   - Markdown syntax validation

2. **Automatic Backup Creation**
   - Timestamped backups before each edit
   - Compressed backups for space efficiency
   - Metadata tracking for recovery

3. **Permission Validation**
   - Read/write permissions check
   - Security permission audit

### Post-Edit Validation

1. **Content Integrity Check**
   - File corruption detection
   - Dependency reference validation
   - Markdown syntax compliance

2. **System Integration Validation**
   - Full memory system validation

## 7. Best Practices

### Editing Best Practices
1. **Always use the memory manager** for editing operations
2. **Create checkpoints** before major changes
3. **Validate immediately** after editing
4. **Monitor system health** regularly
5. **Clean up backups** periodically

### Safety Best Practices
1. **Never bypass safety checks** without good reason
2. **Use dry-run mode** for unfamiliar operations
3. **Keep emergency backups** current
4. **Document all manual recovery actions**
5. **Test recovery procedures** periodically

### Recovery Best Practices
1. **Assess damage scope** before attempting recovery
2. **Create emergency backup** before recovery attempts
3. **Use least invasive recovery method** first
4. **Validate completely** after recovery
5. **Document lessons learned** from incidents

## 8. Emergency Contact Procedures

### Escalation Path
1. **Level 1**: Automated recovery procedures
2. **Level 2**: Manual recovery using documented procedures
3. **Level 3**: Emergency system rebuild from checkpoints
4. **Level 4**: Complete system reinitialiation (last resort)

### Recovery Documentation
All recovery actions must be documented in:
- System logs (`/.claude/memory_safety.log`)
- Recovery reports (generated with `--report` flag)
- Manual incident notes for future reference

This framework ensures comprehensive safety and recoverability for the memory system while maintaining operational efficiency and data integrity.
