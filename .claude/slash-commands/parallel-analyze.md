# Parallel System Analysis

This command spawns 4 agents simultaneously to analyze a system comprehensively:

**Usage:** `/parallel-analyze "system or component name"`

**Agents spawned in parallel:**
- security-enforcer: Security vulnerability analysis
- performance-optimizer: Performance bottleneck identification  
- test-specialist: Test coverage and quality assessment
- infrastructure-engineer: Infrastructure and deployment analysis

**Example:** `/parallel-analyze "authentication system"`

## Implementation

This command will execute the following parallel agent coordination:

```
meta-coordinator: "Comprehensive 4-agent analysis of [system] spanning security, performance, testing, and infrastructure domains. Execute parallel analysis pattern with security-enforcer, performance-optimizer, test-specialist, and infrastructure-engineer."
```

The meta-coordinator will handle the parallel execution and provide integrated results.
