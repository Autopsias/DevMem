# Parallel Feature Development

This command spawns 6 agents simultaneously for complete feature development lifecycle:

**Usage:** `/parallel-develop "feature description"`

**Agents spawned in parallel:**
- code-quality-specialist: Code quality and security scanning
- test-specialist: Test strategy and coverage analysis
- security-enforcer: Security requirements and implementation
- infrastructure-engineer: Infrastructure and deployment strategy
- environment-analyst: Environment setup and dependencies
- ci-specialist: CI/CD pipeline updates and automation

**Example:** `/parallel-develop "user dashboard with real-time notifications"`

## Implementation

This command will execute the following parallel agent coordination:

```
meta-coordinator: "Comprehensive 6-agent feature development for [feature] spanning code quality, testing, security, infrastructure, environment, and CI/CD domains. Execute parallel development pattern with complete lifecycle coordination."
```

The meta-coordinator will handle the parallel execution and provide integrated development plan.
