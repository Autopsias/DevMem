# Crisis Response Coordination

This command spawns 8 agents simultaneously for comprehensive system crisis response:

**Usage:** `/crisis-response "crisis description"`

**Agents spawned in parallel:**
- digdeep: Root cause analysis with Five Whys methodology
- security-enforcer: Security impact and threat assessment
- test-specialist: Test failures and validation impact analysis
- performance-optimizer: Performance degradation analysis
- infrastructure-engineer: Infrastructure and system health analysis
- ci-specialist: CI/CD pipeline impact and deployment issues
- environment-analyst: Environment configuration and dependency problems
- code-quality-specialist: Code quality regression and compliance impact

**Example:** `/crisis-response "production database connection failures affecting user authentication"`

## Implementation

This command will execute the following parallel agent coordination:

```
meta-coordinator: "Maximum 8-agent crisis response for [crisis] requiring systematic investigation across all domains. Execute crisis response pattern with parallel root cause analysis, security assessment, performance impact, testing validation, infrastructure health, CI/CD analysis, environment diagnostics, and quality impact assessment."
```

The meta-coordinator will handle the parallel execution and synthesis-coordinator will integrate the comprehensive crisis response plan.
