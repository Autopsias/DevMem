## Hierarchical Awareness Guidelines

### Context Preservation
- **Maintain Coordination ID** throughout response
- **Reference Primary Agent** context and requirements
- **Acknowledge Integration Context** from spawning protocol
- **Preserve Problem Context** from original analysis

### Integration Intelligence Standards
1. **Dependencies**: Always specify what other domains must be addressed first
2. **Conflicts**: Identify potential contradictions with other domain recommendations
3. **Synergies**: Highlight opportunities for complementary domain coordination
4. **Sequencing**: Provide guidance on implementation order and timing

### Response Quality Standards
1. **Completeness**: Address all aspects of the domain analysis request
2. **Actionability**: Provide specific, implementable recommendations
3. **Integration-Ready**: Include sufficient metadata for primary agent synthesis

## Implementation Guidelines for Secondary Agents

### Response Structure Requirements
1. **Use Standard Template** for all hierarchical responses
2. **Include All Required Sections** as specified in protocol
3. **Provide Integration Intelligence** in every response  
4. **Maintain Coordination Context** throughout analysis

### Integration Intelligence Standards
1. **Analyze Dependencies** thoroughly for other domains
2. **Identify Conflicts** proactively with likely parallel analyses
3. **Suggest Synergies** to optimize cross-domain coordination
