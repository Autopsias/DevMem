# Parallel Feature Development: $ARGUMENTS

## Multi-Agent Development Coordination

Execute comprehensive feature development for $ARGUMENTS using advanced parallel agent coordination.

**Coordination Strategy**: Use Task tool to invoke analysis-gateway for comprehensive development routing:

"Coordinate comprehensive feature development for $ARGUMENTS:

**Development Domains**:
- Code quality analysis and implementation via code-quality-specialist
- Test strategy and implementation via test-specialist
- Security requirements and implementation via security-enforcer
- Infrastructure planning and setup via infrastructure-engineer
- Environment configuration and management via environment-analyst
- CI/CD pipeline integration via ci-specialist

**Execution Pattern**: 6-agent parallel batch with comprehensive coordination and result synthesis.

**Expected Deliverable**: Complete feature implementation roadmap with coordinated execution plan, including:
- Development implementation strategy
- Comprehensive testing approach
- Security requirements and implementation
- Infrastructure and deployment planning
- Environment setup and configuration
- CI/CD integration and automation"

## Advanced Development Coordination
- **Complete feature lifecycle** from planning to deployment
- **Parallel domain expertise** with specialized agent coordination
- **Integrated implementation plan** with clear sequencing and dependencies
- **Quality assurance** across all development aspects

Execute comprehensive feature development coordination with parallel agent expertise.
