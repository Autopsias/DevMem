# Deep Analysis with Agent Coordination

Perform comprehensive Five Whys root cause analysis with systematic secondary agent coordination following Anthropic's natural delegation patterns.

## Usage
```
/deep-analysis [problem-description] [domain]
```

**Arguments:**
- `problem-description`: Description of the complex technical problem
- `domain`: Optional domain focus (performance, security, architecture, testing, infrastructure)

## Analysis Framework

**Primary Analysis**: Start with digdeep agent for Five Whys methodology with MCP-enhanced intelligence

**Systematic Secondary Agent Coordination** (based on root cause analysis):

### Technical Domain Coordination
- **Async/Concurrency Issues** → async-pattern-fixer
- **Performance Bottlenecks** → performance-optimizer + resource-optimizer
- **Security Vulnerabilities** → security-auditor
- **Dependency Conflicts** → dependency-resolver

### Architecture & Design Coordination
- **Pattern Compliance Issues** → pattern-analyzer
- **Refactoring Complexity** → refactoring-coordinator
- **Configuration Drift** → configuration-validator

### Testing & Quality Coordination
- **Test Architecture Issues** → test-specialist + coverage-optimizer
- **Mock Architecture Complexity** → mock-configuration-expert
- **Quality Assurance** → validation-tester

### Infrastructure & Deployment Coordination
- **Docker Orchestration Issues** → docker-specialist
- **Environment Synchronization** → environment-synchronizer
- **Workflow Optimization** → workflow-optimizer

## Natural Language Coordination Pattern

The digdeep agent will provide systematic recommendations:

> "Five Whys root cause analysis reveals [fundamental issue requiring specialized expertise]. This comprehensive analysis would benefit from coordinating with `[secondary-agent]` for [specific specialized capability]. I recommend engaging them with this detailed context: [complete Five Whys findings, root cause analysis, and specific areas requiring specialized attention]."

## Multi-Agent Coordination Examples

**Complex System Issues**: digdeep → performance-optimizer + security-auditor + pattern-analyzer
**Architecture Problems**: digdeep → refactoring-coordinator + pattern-analyzer + dependency-resolver
**Quality & Testing**: digdeep → test-specialist + coverage-optimizer + mock-configuration-expert
