# CI/CD Fix

Analyze and fix CI/CD pipeline issues, GitHub Actions workflows, and Docker service orchestration problems, focusing on: ${ARGUMENTS:-all workflows}

This command addresses CI/CD infrastructure problems and will naturally engage specialized CI/CD expertise based on the context.

## CI/CD Analysis Focus

**GitHub Actions Workflows:**
- YAML syntax errors and configuration issues
- Job dependencies and execution order problems
- Action compatibility and version conflicts
- Matrix build failures and environment issues

**Docker Service Orchestration:**
- Container health checks and startup issues
- Service networking and connectivity problems
- Service timing and dependency coordination
- Multi-service integration and communication

**Environment Synchronization:**
- Dependency mismatches between environments
- Environment variables and configuration drift
- Installation failures and package conflicts
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

**Performance & Reliability:**
- Pipeline timeouts and execution bottlenecks
- Flaky tests and unreliable test execution
- Resource optimization and caching strategies
- Cross-platform build and deployment issues

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Specific file-level fixes with exact line numbers
- Configuration changes across environments
- Performance optimizations and caching improvements
- Reliability enhancements while maintaining workflow integrity
