# Deep Problem Analysis

Why is this broken? Find out what's wrong and analyze this issue: ${ARGUMENTS:-system failure requiring investigation}

This naturally triggers Claude Code's digdeep agent for comprehensive Five Whys analysis and root cause investigation, with MCP-enhanced capabilities for expert knowledge access.

**Analysis Focus:**
- Root cause identification across multiple system layers
- Cross-system integration issues and dependencies
- Performance bottlenecks and architectural problems
- Environment configuration and service coordination
- Code quality/security/compliance issues
- Test failures/CI-CD pipeline problems

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Five Whys methodology with MCP-enhanced knowledge access
- Official documentation and SDK patterns via MCP
- Latest industry practices and solutions via Exa MCP
- Expert-level analysis for complex decisions via Perplexity MCP
- Coordination with specialized agents for multi-domain expertise

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Root cause analysis with supporting evidence
- Comprehensive solution plan with implementation steps
- Priority-ordered action items with success metrics
- Agent coordination recommendations for specialized work
- Documentation updates and knowledge capture
