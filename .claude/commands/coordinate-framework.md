# Coordinate Framework Command

Perform comprehensive framework architecture analysis and agent ecosystem coordination using the framework-coordinator agent.

## Analysis Types

### Quick Framework Analysis (Default)
Rapid framework health assessment with key metrics and immediate recommendations:
- Agent inventory and health status
- Claude Code compliance overview
- Integration health check
- Priority optimization recommendations

### Comprehensive Framework Review
Complete framework architecture assessment and strategic planning:
- Deep architecture analysis with dependency mapping
- User workflow pattern analysis and optimization
- Framework evolution strategy and roadmap
- Detailed implementation guidance for improvements

### Compliance Validation
Focused Claude Code standards compliance assessment:
- Sub-agent architecture validation against Anthropic patterns
- Memory system, hooks, and slash command integration check
- Tool permission and coordination pattern validation
- Documentation alignment with official standards

## Framework Coordination Capabilities

### 1. Architecture Analysis
- **Agent Ecosystem Mapping**: Complete agent inventory with relationship analysis
- **Coordination Pattern Assessment**: Cross-agent communication effectiveness
- **Dependency Analysis**: Agent dependency mapping and optimization opportunities
- **Architecture Debt Identification**: Framework improvement priorities

### 2. Claude Code Compliance
- **Standards Validation**: Alignment with official Anthropic documentation
- **Integration Assessment**: Memory, hooks, and MCP server integration health
- **Tool Permission Audit**: Appropriate tool access across all agents
- **Coordination Pattern Validation**: Natural language coordination effectiveness

### 3. User Workflow Optimization
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Agent invocation and workflow efficiency assessment
- **Gap Identification**: Uncovered user needs and framework coverage analysis
- **Workflow Bottleneck Detection**: Performance optimization opportunities
- **Framework Enhancement Recommendations**: Evidence-based improvement suggestions

### 4. Framework Evolution Strategy
- **Strategic Roadmap**: Framework evolution planning and prioritization
- **Scaling Strategy**: Agent ecosystem growth and optimization planning
- **Best Practices Development**: Framework guidelines and standards creation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing framework monitoring and enhancement

## Official Documentation Integration

The framework coordinator references and validates against:
- **Sub-Agent Standards**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
- **Slash Command Patterns**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands
- **Memory System Integration**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory#how-claude-looks-up-memories
- **Hook System Guidelines**: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide

## Expected Outputs

### Framework Health Dashboard
- ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´ Agent ecosystem health indicators
- Claude Code compliance scores across all agents
- Integration health metrics (MCP, hooks, memory system)
- Priority optimization recommendations with implementation guidance

### Strategic Analysis Report
- Framework architecture assessment with improvement roadmap
- User workflow optimization opportunities and recommendations
- Agent coordination effectiveness analysis and enhancement suggestions
- Framework evolution strategy with measurable success metrics

### Compliance Assessment
- Detailed Claude Code standards compliance validation
- Integration pattern effectiveness analysis
- Tool permission and coordination optimization recommendations
- Documentation alignment verification with official standards

## Usage Examples

**Quick Framework Health Check:**
```
/coordinate-framework
```

**Comprehensive Framework Analysis:**
```
/coordinate-framework comprehensive
```

**Claude Code Compliance Validation:**
```
/coordinate-framework compliance
```

**Custom Analysis Focus:**
```
/coordinate-framework quick integration-health
/coordinate-framework comprehensive user-workflows
/coordinate-framework compliance tool-permissions
```

## Integration with Existing Agents

The framework coordinator works collaboratively with:
- **agent-reviewer**: Leverages individual agent health data for ecosystem analysis
- **agent-creator**: Coordinates gap analysis and new agent recommendation strategies
- **digdeep**: Utilizes for complex framework issue root cause analysis
- **Specialized agents**: Engages domain experts for specific framework optimization areas

## Success Indicators

- **Framework Health Score**: â‰¥95% overall ecosystem health and compliance
- **User Workflow Efficiency**: Measurable improvement in user interaction patterns
- **Integration Effectiveness**: â‰¥98% successful cross-agent coordination
- **Evolution Velocity**: Quantifiable framework improvement implementation rate
