## Purpose
Unified coordination intelligence consolidating all agent patterns, performance baselines, and coordination strategies into a streamlined 2-level hierarchy for optimal performance and maintainability.

## 1. Agent Routing Intelligence (Core System)

### Standardized Domain Routing Criteria
**Primary Agent Selection Patterns (Single Domain ≥90% confidence):**
```
# Testing Domain
"test failures", "pytest issues", "async testing", "mock configuration" � test-specialist
"coverage gaps", "testing strategy", "integration testing" � test-specialist

# Security Domain  
"security vulnerabilities", "security audit", "threat modeling" � security-enforcer
"vulnerability scanning", "compliance validation" � security-auditor (secondary)

# Infrastructure Domain
"docker issues", "container orchestration", "infrastructure problems" � infrastructure-engineer
"deployment issues", "environment configuration" � environment-analyst

# Performance Domain
"performance bottlenecks", "optimization analysis", "slow performance" � performance-optimizer
"resource optimization", "scaling issues" � resource-optimizer (secondary)

# Documentation Domain
"api documentation", "technical writing", "user guides" � documentation-enhancer
"README generation", "technical specifications" � documentation-enhancer
```

### Multi-Domain Coordination Patterns
**Natural Language Patterns for Claude Code Native Execution:**
```
"using X tasks in parallel" � analysis-gateway � Direct parallel execution (98% success)
"coordinating [analysis] using N tasks in parallel" � analysis-gateway � Coordination-focused execution (96% success)  
"analyzing [problem] using parallel assessment across X domains" � analysis-gateway � Domain-specific parallel (94% success)
```

### Strategic Meta-Coordination Triggers
**Complex System Patterns (5+ domains):**
```
"strategic coordination", "crisis response", "system-wide analysis" � meta-coordinator
"complex system architecture", "cross-domain integration" � meta-coordinator
"comprehensive system overhaul", "multi-domain crisis" � meta-coordinator
```

### Standardized Coordination Decision Matrix
**Agent Selection Priority Framework:**
1. **Single Domain Match (≥90% confidence)** � Direct primary agent routing
2. **Multi-Domain Detection (2-4 domains)** � analysis-gateway coordination  
3. **Strategic Complexity (5+ domains)** � meta-coordinator orchestration
4. **Secondary Agent Needs** � Automatic secondary agent spawning based on domain requirements

**Domain Boundary Clarity Rules:**
- **Primary Agents**: Handle 80%+ of domain problems independently
- **Secondary Agents**: Spawned for specialized sub-domain expertise
- **Cross-Domain**: analysis-gateway for 2-4 domains, meta-coordinator for 5+
- **Conflict Resolution**: Security > Stability > Performance > Convenience

**Standardized Coordination ID Generation:**
```python
# Uniform coordination ID format for all agents
def generate_coordination_id(agent_name, problem_domain):
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
    domain_hash = hashlib.md5(f"{agent_name}_{problem_domain}".encode()).hexdigest()[:6].upper()
    return f"COORD-{agent_name}-{timestamp}-{domain_hash}"
```

### Learning-Based Agent Selection Algorithm

#### Primary Selection Logic
```python
def select_agent_with_learning(user_input, context):
    # Extract keywords from user input
    keywords = extract_keywords(user_input)
    
    # Find matching learned patterns
    matching_patterns = find_patterns_by_keywords(keywords)
    
    # Sort by confidence score (descending)
    sorted_patterns = sort_by_confidence(matching_patterns)
    
    # Apply confidence threshold (>= 0.7 for learned patterns)
    high_confidence_patterns = filter_by_confidence(sorted_patterns, 0.7)
    
    if high_confidence_patterns:
        return select_highest_confidence_agent(high_confidence_patterns)
    else:
        return fallback_to_natural_selection(user_input, context)
```

#### Pattern Confidence Calculation
```python
def calculate_confidence(successes, total_attempts, time_decay_factor):
    base_confidence = successes / total_attempts
    time_weight = apply_time_decay(time_decay_factor)  # Recent successes weighted higher
    
    return min(base_confidence * time_weight, 1.0)
```
