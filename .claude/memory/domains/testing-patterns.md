## Domain-Specific Agent Selection Intelligence

### Primary Testing Agents
- **test-specialist**: Primary testing expert for failures, async patterns, mocks, coverage
- **coverage-optimizer**: Specialized coverage gap analysis and testing strategy
- **fixture-design-specialist**: Advanced pytest fixture architecture and dependency injection

### Testing Integration Patterns

#### **Async Testing Coordination**
```
User Context: "Test failures with async patterns and mock configuration"
� test-specialist (primary)
� Coordination: async-pattern-fixer + mock-configuration-expert
� Success Rate: 94% for async + mock issues
```

#### **Coverage Architecture Issues**
```
User Context: "Test coverage gaps requiring architectural improvements"
� coverage-optimizer (primary)
� Coordination: fixture-design-specialist + integration-validator
� Success Rate: 91% for coverage + architecture issues
```

#### **Integration Testing Complexity**
```
User Context: "End-to-end testing failures across multiple services"
� integration-validator (primary)
� Coordination: test-specialist + docker-specialist
� Success Rate: 88% for integration + infrastructure issues
```

### Testing Performance Patterns

#### **Response Time Optimization**
- **test-specialist**: Average 1.2s response for standard test failures
- **coverage-optimizer**: Average 2.1s for complex coverage analysis
- **fixture-design-specialist**: Average 1.8s for fixture architecture

#### **Coordination Efficiency**
- **Single Test Issue**: Direct agent selection (0.9s average)
- **Multi-Test Domains**: Primary + 1-2 secondary agents (1.5s average)
- **Architecture Testing**: Meta-orchestration for 4+ domains (2.3s average)

### Common Testing Scenarios

#### **High-Success Patterns**
1. **Pytest + AsyncMock Issues**: test-specialist � async-pattern-fixer (96% success)
2. **Coverage + Fixture Architecture**: coverage-optimizer � fixture-design-specialist (93% success)
3. **Integration + Service Testing**: integration-validator � docker-specialist (90% success)

#### **Meta-Orchestration Triggers**
- **Testing + Security + CI + Performance**: 4+ domains � meta-coordinator
- **Architecture + Testing + Integration + Environment**: Complex cross-system issues
- **Performance + Testing + Infrastructure + Configuration**: Multi-layer testing problems

### RAG MemoryBank MCP Testing Context

#### **Project-Specific Testing Intelligence**
- **Coverage Requirement**: e82% coverage validation required
- **Testing Commands**: `make test-coverage`, `./scripts/ci-modular-runner.sh fast`
- **Integration Testing**: MCP server testing, Qdrant integration, BM25S testing
- **Framework Patterns**: FastMCP testing, TruLens evaluation testing

#### **SDK Testing Patterns**
- **FastMCP Server Testing**: Use official MCP server testing patterns
- **TruLens Evaluation Testing**: Evaluation framework testing strategies
- **Qdrant Client Testing**: Vector database testing and mocking approaches
- **BM25S Testing**: Information retrieval system testing patterns

## Testing Domain Memory Performance Intelligence

### Memory-Enhanced Testing Coordination
```markdown
Testing Issue Resolution Flow with Memory Integration:
User Testing Problem → @testing-patterns.md Context → Cross-Domain Lookup → Specialist Selection
          ↓                        ↓                       ↓                    ↓
   "Async Test Failures" → Async Testing Patterns → @project-specific-patterns.md → async-pattern-fixer
   "Coverage Gaps" → Coverage Architecture → @agent-coordination-core.md → coverage-optimizer
   "MCP Server Testing" → FastMCP Testing → @project-specific-patterns.md → test-specialist
```

### Testing Memory Lookup Performance Metrics
- **Testing Pattern Access**: 15ms average lookup time
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: 96% success for testing + infrastructure coordination
- **Memory-Enhanced Selection**: 94% accuracy in testing specialist routing
- **Context Preservation**: 97% retention through testing → implementation → validation sequences
