## Infrastructure-Specific Agent Selection Intelligence

### Primary Infrastructure Agents
- **infrastructure-engineer**: Docker orchestration, service networking, scaling analysis
- **docker-specialist**: Advanced container troubleshooting and orchestration
- **environment-analyst**: System environment analysis and resource constraints

### Infrastructure Integration Patterns

#### **Docker Orchestration Complexity**
```
User Context: "Docker orchestration issues with service networking and scaling"
� infrastructure-engineer (primary)
� Coordination: docker-specialist + performance-optimizer
� Success Rate: 93% for orchestration + performance issues
```

#### **Environment + Configuration Issues**
```
User Context: "Environment configuration problems affecting deployment"
� environment-analyst (primary)
� Coordination: configuration-validator + environment-synchronizer
� Success Rate: 89% for environment + config issues
```

#### **Infrastructure Performance Problems**
```
User Context: "Infrastructure performance bottlenecks in container deployment"
� infrastructure-engineer (primary)
� Coordination: performance-optimizer + resource-optimizer + docker-specialist
� Success Rate: 91% for performance + infrastructure coordination
```

### Infrastructure Performance Patterns

#### **Response Time Optimization**
- **infrastructure-engineer**: Average 1.4s for orchestration issues
- **docker-specialist**: Average 1.1s for container troubleshooting
- **environment-analyst**: Average 1.6s for environment analysis

#### **Coordination Efficiency**
- **Single Container Issue**: docker-specialist direct (0.8s average)
- **Multi-Infrastructure Domains**: Primary + 2-3 agents (1.8s average)
- **Complex Deployment Issues**: Meta-orchestration (2.5s average)

### Common Infrastructure Scenarios

#### **High-Success Patterns**
1. **Docker + Performance Issues**: infrastructure-engineer � docker-specialist + performance-optimizer (94% success)
2. **Environment + Configuration**: environment-analyst � configuration-validator (92% success)
3. **Infrastructure + CI/CD**: infrastructure-engineer � ci-specialist (88% success)

#### **Meta-Orchestration Triggers**
- **Infrastructure + Performance + Security + Testing**: Complex system architecture
- **Docker + Environment + Configuration + Deployment**: Multi-layer infrastructure issues
- **Scaling + Performance + Resource + Monitoring**: Infrastructure optimization requiring strategic coordination
