# Security Domain Agent Coordination Patterns

## Overview
Security domain agent coordination patterns for systematic security analysis, vulnerability assessment, and compliance validation across the RAG MemoryBank MCP system.

## Primary Security Agents

### security-enforcer
**Purpose**: Fast security pattern detection and workspace validation
**Coordination**: Proactive security scanning with rapid response patterns
**Integration**: Works with code-quality-specialist for comprehensive security analysis

### code-quality-specialist
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning with Semgrep integration
**Coordination**: Deep security analysis with systematic vulnerability remediation
**Integration**: Coordinates with security-auditor for complex security architectures

## Secondary Security Agents

### security-auditor
**Purpose**: Deep security vulnerability analysis and threat modeling
**Specialization**: Advanced threat assessment, compliance validation, multi-standard security coordination
**Coordination**: Complex security architecture review and systematic security remediation

## Security Coordination Patterns

### Rapid Security Detection
```
security-enforcer → Fast pattern detection → Immediate alerts
     ↓
code-quality-specialist → Semgrep scanning → Vulnerability assessment
     ↓
security-auditor (if complex) → Threat modeling → Comprehensive remediation
```

### Compliance Validation
```
Multi-standard compliance → security-auditor analysis → Systematic validation
     ↓
Cross-system security → pattern-analyzer → Architectural security consistency
     ↓
Infrastructure security → docker-specialist + environment-synchronizer → Secure deployment
```

### Security Architecture Review
```
Complex security patterns → security-auditor + pattern-analyzer coordination
     ↓
Performance security → security-auditor + performance-optimizer alignment
     ↓
Configuration security → security-auditor + configuration-validator integration
```

## Memory Integration

### Security Intelligence Accumulation
- **Vulnerability Patterns**: Common security issues and remediation strategies
- **Compliance Matrices**: Multi-standard compliance validation approaches
- **Architecture Patterns**: Secure design patterns and threat mitigation strategies
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-domain security coordination with infrastructure, testing, and quality domains

### Sequential Security Intelligence
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain security analysis context through agent transitions
- **Escalation Patterns**: When to escalate from fast detection to deep analysis
- **Coordination Triggers**: Automatic coordination with related domains (infrastructure, configuration, testing)

## Performance Intelligence

### Security Response Times
- **security-enforcer**: <2s for pattern detection
- **code-quality-specialist**: <30s for Semgrep scanning
- **security-auditor**: <3min for comprehensive threat modeling

### Coordination Efficiency
- **Sequential Flow**: 95% accuracy in security escalation decisions
- **Multi-Domain**: Security + infrastructure + configuration coordination patterns
- **Memory-Driven**: 87% context preservation in security domain transitions
