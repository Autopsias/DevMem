# Agent Coordination Memory Patterns (Anthropic Standards Compliant)

## Purpose
This memory file captures natural agent coordination patterns following Anthropic's official Claude Code standards for sub-agents, automatic delegation, and hierarchical memory management.

## Compliance with Official Anthropic Standards

### Sub-Agent Architecture (Following Anthropic Documentation)
- **Single-Responsibility Focus**: Each agent has specific, focused expertise area
- **Natural Task Description Delegation**: Automatic delegation based on descriptive task language rather than explicit agent mentions
- **Independent Context Windows**: Each agent maintains separate conversation space
- **Configurable Tool Access**: Minimal required tools with proper security boundaries

### Memory Hierarchy (Following Anthropic Documentation)
- **Project Level**: `./CLAUDE.md` for team-shared instructions and agent coordination patterns
- **User Level**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for personal preferences across projects  
- **Recursive Imports**: Using `@path/to/memory` syntax for modular memory organization
- **Maximum 5-hop Import Depth**: Following Anthropic's recursive import limits

```
