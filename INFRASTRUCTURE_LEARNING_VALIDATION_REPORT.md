- **Weight Adaptation**: Dynamic pattern weight adjustment based on feedback
- **Time Decay**: Recent patterns weighted higher than older patterns
- **Keyword Overlap**: Semantic similarity matching for pattern application

**Learning Categories**:
```python
'container_orchestration': ['docker', 'container', 'kubernetes', 'k8s', 'orchestration']

## Learning System Architecture Details

### 1. Pattern Classification Algorithm

```python
def _classify_infrastructure_query(self, query: str) -> Optional[str]:
    # Multi-keyword matching (requires 2+ matches)
    for query_type, keywords in self.infrastructure_keywords.items():
        matches = sum(1 for keyword in keywords if keyword in query_lower)
        if matches >= 2:
            return query_type
    
    # Strong single keyword fallback
    strong_keywords = {'docker': 'container_orchestration', 'kubernetes': 'container_orchestration'}
    for keyword, query_type in strong_keywords.items():
        if keyword in query_lower:
            return query_type
```

### 2. Learning Feedback Loop

```python
def learn_from_success(self, query: str, selected_agent: str, confidence: float):
    if confidence >= self.learning_threshold:  # 0.75 threshold
        query_type = self._classify_infrastructure_query(query)
        pattern_key = f"{query_type}:{selected_agent}"
        
        # Store successful pattern with metadata
        self.successful_patterns[query_type].append({
            'pattern': pattern_key,
            'agent': selected_agent,
            'confidence': confidence,
            'query_keywords': self._extract_keywords(query),
            'timestamp': time.time()
        })
        
        # Increase pattern weight
        self.pattern_weights[pattern_key] += 0.1
```

### 3. Agent Selection Enhancement

```python
def get_learned_agent_suggestion(self, query: str) -> Optional[Tuple[str, float]]:
    # Calculate scores based on keyword overlap and learned weights
    base_score = pattern['confidence'] * (keyword_overlap / max(len(query_keywords), 1))
    weight_boost = self.pattern_weights.get(pattern_key, 0.0)
    
    # Time decay factor (30-day effective window)
    time_factor = max(0.5, 1.0 - (time.time() - pattern['timestamp']) / (30 * 24 * 3600))
    
    final_score = base_score + weight_boost * time_factor
    return highest_scoring_agent
```
