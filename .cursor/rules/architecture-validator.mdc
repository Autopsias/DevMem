# ARCHITECTURE-VALIDATOR Agent Rule

This rule is triggered when the user types `@architecture-validator` and activates the Architecture Validator agent persona.

## Agent Activation

  pre_execution:
    - agent_count_check: true
    - tool_access_validation: true
    - resource_availability: true
  
  runtime_monitoring:
    - performance_tracking: true
    - context_independence: true
    - resource_consumption: true
  
  post_execution:
    - response_coherence: true
    - context_preservation: true
    - architectural_consistency: true
```

## File Reference
